   [[OOC]]
   Our illustrious GM caught me online and off guard
   by telling me Jax had died! Sadly, he was
   mistaken....
   <p>
   [[ICN]]
   <p>
   Jax awakes with a slight headache and discovers
   that he is profusely chained from head to toe
   against a stone pillar. It is pitch-dark,
   and his HotVision(TM) is useless through the
   leather hood over his head. He feels the cold
   steel of his sheathed scimitar pressing
   uncomfortably against his left leg, but his hands
   are hopelessly bound beyond any chance of
   movement. Thank Lerotra'hh, he is alive.
   <p>
   "Kopfy? Mike? What happened?" He hears
   strangely muffled groans echoing from no place in
   particular.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   "My theory is that we were attacked by a heffalump
   from behind while I was busy rescuing us by pressing the
   history eraser button. Then our unconscious bodies were
   chained up here by klangroos until we give them the secret of
   reaching the north pole. 
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   At least all the evidence points to that."
   "I'm here, Jax. All chained up and can't see a
   thing!" Kopfy emanates darkly.
   <p>
   "Me TOO!!" Michael submits...
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Or I could say this instead.<br>
   (Submit? Heck no, I'm only pinned or disqualified.)
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   ..., along with a phalanx
   of shrieks from somewhere close by. But Jax
   really cannot tell for sure. And that stench!
   "MIKE!! PUT A LID ON IT!!"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Hey, keep the noise down Jax. Someone will hear.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Kofpy, you gotta spell for this occasion?"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Just don't ask Taran to spell.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   A sigh echoes overhead. "No, Jax, I'm spent. But
   I'm gonna take it outta Mike's hide if we ever get
   outta here."
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Big talk from a guy chained up wearing a leather bag over his head.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   "From the smell of it, we may be here for a
   while," Jax replies. Whoever put them here must
   not check the chains very often, he surmises,
   imagining a rotting corpse as the malodorous
   source.
   <p>
   Mike's cacophony continues again, and Jax tries to
   discern the topography of their prison using the
   magician's echos.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   That was my plan exactly.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   The room seems large. When
   Mike realizes he can't breathe in the near-suffocating hood and shout at the
   same time, he stops.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Nah, keep shrieking. Eventually, you pass out and start breathing again
   anyway, so it's really pointless to stop if that's all you have to do.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   But a lingering, diffuse echo does not abate.
   "Hey, guys, does that sound like voices?"
   <p>
   The room replies vaguely, "Grannsnns gegr..gege..
   gege... Greerann."
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   This would be an appropriate place to try responding in Porker.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Is that Taran's voice vibrating through the walls?
   Jax briefly ponders whether it shares the same
   rhythm and tempo as his ever-yappy brother's yaps.
   Grasping at straws, he yells an ancient Dracon
   tribal war-cry, nearly suffocating himself with
   an overusage of oxygen.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   I hope it was yelled in Porker.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   "You just told me not to yell!" Mike exclaims.
   <p>
   "Shaddup!" yells Kopfy, "You got us in this mess
   by pressing that button!"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Wah, wah, wah, eat your milk and cookies, wah, wah, wah...
   Everyone's out of the pit, aren't they? Some people just can't
   see the forest but for the trees.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Jax strains to hear an answer to his cry, but
   the muffled sounds continue unabated. 
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   Sigh, it looks like I'll have to rescue us again. 
   I'll whistle for Jean-Clod van Darn.
   <hr></blockquote>

   <p>
   [[GM]] Rumbling out of the darkness like rolling thunder,
   the large Rhino comes sliding to a stop just few short
   of Taran.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   It worked again.
   (How much does Purina Rhino Chow cost per month?)
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Its large horn could have easily made an orc-ka-bob out of him.
   Shipy slowly pulls Lilac's light stick
   from its hidden location. Instantly the room is filled with light.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   You mean my luster has dimmed?
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Blinking a few times from blindness both of them
   see Lilac seated on the Rhino's head smiling.
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] "Hi boys! Wasn't afraid just a wee bit were u?" she giggles,
   fluttering her wings for effect (which sounds
   like a humming bird).
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   "Hooray! Tinkerbell and Jean-Clod van Darn have arrived!"
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   [[GM]] With the light everyone can see Shipy's arm is wounded and he is
   bleeding.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   593 - eickeric - 5/13/00 5:11 am
   <p>
   "Oh, and Shippo too." 
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Beyond the Rhino back
   down the passage where the trip wire was rests the very smashed corpses
   of two large ogre's (and a secret
   door stands open on one wall). It is a very gruesome sight,
   and the large Rhino now has red legs (from the
   grape.. er, ogre smashing).
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Mother fruitier! Gezz Taran, why'd have to go and shoot me!
   I'm bleeding and I might even die!"
   Holding his arm up blood starts dripping from it steadily.
   "Ah Fruit-Cake... you even went and ripped my shirt
   again!" He grimaces in pain as only a hobbit can.

   Hi Jax, unfortunately, I'm still away, just happened to visit a friend
   with a computer. I'll prolly still be offline until early June, so jimship is

   [OOC:]<br>
   Although I LOVE your whinning, there is just one problem that I have:
   <p>
   You left your Rhino and ran down the stairs and I went and got him so
   he's mine and I get to name him. None of this Jean-Clod van Darn
   stuff anymore. His name is Vortex &lt;I thought of that name all by
   myself :)&gt; and it was cleared by our wonderful GM
   &lt;may he live forever&gt;.
   <p>
   Another thing is tinkerbell!!! Geesh, cann't you ever get a girl's
   name right??? That's three and I want you to forget them all otherwise you'll
   get hit by some faerie dust and you won't like that!!!

   [ICN:]<br>
   Giggling at the sight of a scared hobby and an orc,
   I fondly pat my rhino's neck.
   <p>
   "This is Vortex, fellas. I hit him with a touch of faerie dust
   (that's my one time use for the week). He's my friend now.
   Sweet, ain't he?" I ask as I admire my new pet.
   <p>
   Noticing hobbys bloody arm, I take a short breath and whistle
   between my teeth (as only a sprite can do). "Wow, thats not a pretty
   sight hobby. What'd you go and hurt youreslf on this time? Geesh,
   we really can't take you anywhere now can we?" Mutters under breath
   "Hobbits."
   <p>
   I fly up in the air and hover in front of hobbys arm looking at the
   damage. Gently poking and prodding, I address him, "Just a flesh wound,
   it's not deep but grazed your skin enough to get it bleeding nicely."
   <p>
   I reach into my pouch and pull out a needle and thread. Threading
   the needle I mutter under my breath. A few words such as "trouble
   maker, can't behave, make my life harder, giving me gray hair"
   can be heard occasionaly. 
   <p>
   Looking up at hobby, I say "You're not gonna like me in a moment ya
   know but that's ok, I will forgive you." I say with a smile playing on my
   lips and my eyes as big as saucers.

   [OOC- For those of you who have not been paying attention.
   The G-Mist group has found their way deep into the bowels of the sewer
   (hehehe), and after some investigating by Michael of the Midnight
   Magicks he pushed a button (yes, he did). Upon doing so it magically
   divided the party in half. Right now Kopfy, Michael of the Midnight
   Magicks, and Jax are trapped (somewhere), hooded and log-chained
   to stone pillars. Not as happy as they could be.
   <p>
   The other half of the group; Lilac, Taran, Shipy, and Vortex
   (the newly joined Rhino, created by Michael's wand) are in a room trying to
   decide what they should do next. A trip wire set off by Vortex opened
   a secret door (near two smashed ogre’s, Vortex’s doing), giving
   them a new and possible alternate route. When (Lilac, Taran, Shipy,
   and Vortex) decide what to do next, then our game will continue. End
   of news update.]

   worth).

   [OOC:] I like how map beautiful map keeps getting updated.
   It really is a nice piece of work. Maybe I am in the wrong line of buisness.
   Should I becaome a map maker instead? Wait, nope, can't do that..
   who would keep an eye on hobby then? Everyone know he can't stay
   out of trouble but then again I could have a never ending supply of
   sun-dried lizards. (Ponders what to do.. what to do...)
   <p>
   [ICN:] Sewing hobby's arm up, I use the extra thread to patch to
   hole closed in his silk shirt so we don't have to listen to him complain
   all the time. Returning the thread and needle back to my pouch hobby
   complains yet again:
   <p>
   "You know, there are two professions you should stay out of:
   the doctor buisness and tailors. For such a delicate being, you don't have a
   soft hand."
   <p>
   I glare at hobby and retort, "Next time do it yourself then you ungrateful
   runt!"
   <p>
   Taran tries to muffle his laughter and fails horridly.
   <p>
   "So," looking around, "Where did everyone else go? I saw a bright flash
   in the tunnel when we were heading over to ya guys but now the
   tunnel is empty," I state.

   down it. "Nothing on HotVision(TM)," he thinks to
   himself. "Ah Jax, what have you gotten yourself

   of the crime, so to speak, and examines the

   [[Taran]] On his way up the stairs,
   Taran spies some writing on the wall. He tries to read the writing,
   but it looks odd.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Hey,
   that writing is upside down!" says the hairy short one, noticing the
   writing, too. With that, Taran scans the stairwell up, and seeing nothing,
   puts down his crossbow and picks up the hobbit by the leg with one arm.
   With the other arm, torch in hand, he illuminates the wall. Shipy
   protests, but soon realizes his unique vantage point. Hanging upside down,
   he reads aloud: "Push here to open, push here to close, and if
   you keep pushing it you're going to break something."
   <p>
   [[Taran]] "I don't guess," Taran offers as he puts the hobbit down right
   side up, "it says what it will be opening." Taran scratches his head
   (insert L1SR on Int made!) "But I guess it should open something up
   at the bottom of the stairs!"
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Could be," I say, trying to shake off the dizzyness.

   [[Taran]] Abandoning his suggestion quickly so as
   to expedite the relocation of his brother and the
   rest of thier team, Taran brainstorms for a new
   idea. "How about I jury-rig one of my missiles
   such that it has a flat front, then fire it at
   the button? With its autoseek enchantment, it's
   an almost sure hit. Maybe we can produce the
   same effect as someone standing there pushing
   it up close and personal?"
   <p>
   He retrieves one of his enchanted bolts and
   tries to think of something he could tie to
   it to produce a flat enough surface to depress
   the button without stabbing into it.
   <p>
   "Whattaya think about that, mates?"

   [[GM]] (Taran is thinking to himself)... Ah, why don't I tie some of
   Shipy's leftover bandages around the end of my crossbow bolt. Since
   the bolts never miss anyway it might just work. After a few minutes of
   preparation Taran takes aim and fires his crossbow with the fist-sized
   cloth wrapped around the end of it.
   <p>
   The crossbow bolt expertly hits the button and a bright flash of light
   fills the stairs and room below for just a second. You see no door open
   or any other clues. The bolt is gone.... (gasp!)
   <p>
   [[[[Mean while somewhere else.... not too distant.]]]]

   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Shrieks, then pauses to catch his
   breath and shrieks some more for good measure.
   <p>
   [[Jax]] "I think I'm getting a headache!" Jax mutters under his hood.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "Think of this as a vacation, with someone standing next to
   you screaming," says the ever wise cracking ork-sage-wizard. All of
   his magical power having now returned.

   <p>
   I stare in amazment as the bolt disappears in mid-air.
   Flying to the the top of the stairs, I examine the stairwell, the wall,
   and the button without going inside the hallway.
   <p>
   "Wowsers. That was pretty amzaing Taran. There has to be some kind of
   spell to transport anything or anyone which touches it to another
   location. Whoever did this is VERY powerful."
   <p>
   I tap my finger against my lip as I ponder the situation.
   "We don't know where this will take us and whether it is a trap or a
   secret entrance of some sort." Turning to face Taran and hobby,
   "I would take the trap door Vortex found. Maybe it is another way to get
   to wherever that button took Jax, Kopfy, and Mike. However,
   the trap door may be a trap and the buttom the right way to go."
   <p>
   Looking between both of them, I shrug my little shoulders.
   "Either of you have coin to flip?"

   [[Taran]] "If the flash of light transports us
   to hostile territory, at least it would transport
   us to our friends--assuming they are still on
   the other end of the transport, and assuming the
   transporter always goes to the same place.
   <p>
   "However, Lilac, as you suggest, it may be a trap,
   in which case we might get trapped, with or
   without our friends."
   <p>
   The orc sadly sides with caution, and suggests,
   "I suppose it would be prudent to at least check
   out the passage your rhino uncovered before
   we proceed to tunnels located not even
   Arahk knows where."
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Maybe we could ask the water weerd
   guy if it knows where they went? After all,
   he pointed us down this passage, so it must
   know the area alright."
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] "Unless it lied to us."
   <p>
   [[Taran]] "We can't be sure of anything. Which
   I suppose is the key to our decision--we can't
   be sure what will happen if we ourselves trigger
   the button-trap. So let's stick to traditional
   delving and check out passageways we can at least
   see. Jax and the rest are probably taking care
   of themselves just fine."

   [[OOC]] Did the crossbow bolt klunk anybody in
   the face on the other end? I hope not.
