   Taran watches as his fellow adventurers for hire settle themselves
   about the floor. He eyes the garbage pile
   suspiciously, and wonders aloud, "Hey guys, why would somebody trap
   the entrance to a room filled with
   garbage? Whattaya think, wanna go trash pickin'?"
   <p>
   Seeing no immediate volunteers to join his garbage sifting,
   he ponders their current situation further. "Hm... With
   silly goblins in the mist running about with their knees bent and all,
   seems like sitting here with our wizard
   batteries low, and with no exit but the way we came in is a bad idea....
   Unless, we bend the rules."
   <p>
   He pulls out his serpent power totem. "I got this from some really powerful
   wizard back in my days as an Agent
   for Arahk Gnahk. Never used it. It's supposed to beef up your ability
   to cast spells." [[ As a refresher course on
   my character sheet, it is a magic totem that grants up to 20 STR for 50
   spellcasting efforts. ]]
   <p>
   He considers his options, as to whom he should ask for tutelage.
   "Lilac? Kopfy? Er, Michael? Know any spells
   you can teach me in a pinch? By the way, I still say we check the garbage."

   What I learned from eickeric's posts: I think we should all remember that
   M of the MM is not actually a wizard,
   and can't cast spells. So as we're writing for him while eickeric is gone,
   no more spells! (We're going to have to
   edit that part out in the final version!)

   OOC: <br>
   Well we had to do something while he was away!
   Glad to have you back, eickeric, and sorry
   if we got MMM wrong, but I sure enjoyed reading
   your critiques. Had me lol in the office, and
   people were starting to look at me funny.
   <p>
   It is kind of awkward to write exclusively about
   one character in game posts, however, so I hope
   people don't mind if I occasionally put words in
   their character's mouth. We can always "edit that 
   part out later," as tarandracon would say.

   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] `Gusundheit'
   I yell loudly, looking around at everyone looking at me.
   Pulling a small fist-sized round black ball from my pocket I
   wait until the pyramid shaped symbol comes to the
   surface inside the glass ball. "I want’a see?" asks Shipy. "No,
   I told you once before, you’re too short!
   Besides... lackeys are never allowed!" I quip.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>

   No way. I gave up quipping for querying. All my quips seem pretty lame.
   Case in point.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   When the pyramid shaped symbol surfaces it reads, ‘Your future
   looks bleak.’ With a slight frown I put it away.
   <p>
   Walking over beside Taran I say, "I would be happy to teach you to spell,
   but you must first start with the
   basics. Sing along with me... ABCDEFGHIGKLMNOP, QRS and TUV, WUX and Y and
   Z. If you need any more help just ask." I smile proudly.

   [[GM]] As Taran walks over to the garbage to start picking through it
   [HE FAILS A LEVEL 3 SR AGAINST DEX.] As he attempted to do some trash
   pickin' the illusionary trash instantly fades revealing a stone stairs going
   steeply downward. Of course by the time he discovers this he is already
   tumbling heading over heels into the
   darkness below saying something to the effect of "Ow, ee, ah, argh, oww, oh,
   ooow!" [TAKE 5 HITS. THIS
   HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME MICHAEL IS USING HIS WAND.]
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Pointing my wand down the sewer
   passage I push the black button. A
   burst of energy explodes into the sewer passage, and a moment later
   stands a very large angry looking Rhino.
   "Ooops... time to save Taran!" Turning I rush down the stairs bravely,
   and the rest of the group follows quickly
   behind before the Rhino has time to react.

   The rest
   would make his mother frown. At the bottom, he
   did a quick scan of his surroundings utilizing
   his infravision. Bruised bones, cuts, scrapes,
   and bent pride needed to be put aside.
   <p>
   "Speaking of putting things aside," he thought
   to himself, "it seems my companions are joining
   me, post haste!" He gathered himself together
   and got out from the bottom of the stairs. He
   did a quick visual surveillance of his
   extremeties (VSE) to make sure all his digits
   and limbs still worked, and assuming the worst,
   fumbled for his cranequin to crank another bolt.

   [[Taran]] Having no more than ceased rolling and stood up,
   you turn to see all of your companions come
   charging down the stairs. Moving out of the way you look at yourself,
   and other than all the cuts and bruises you
   look to be fine. Being the first down Michael hands you back your half used,
   but still burning torch. With Lilac’s
   light and your torch you see you are in a smooth (20 by 20 foot) plain room.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] Still breathing heavy he says, "I just might need that serpent
   power totem of yours if I don’t get
   strength back soon Taran! I didn't get much up there."
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] Also still panting from running Shipy withdraws a small vial
   from his hip pouch and hands it to you.
   "Drink this Taran, cause you’re not looking to good. Not that it will help
   your looks any, but it will heal your
   wounds. Trust me, its not poison, I’m sure I got the labels right this

   At the bottom of the stairs, Jax finds his
   brother contemplating Shipy's vial with upraised
   brow. "Hmm. Welp, here's mud in yer eye!"
   Taran mutters to Jax with vial upraised. Taran
   gulps noisily ("Guhhh-ga-guh-ga-guh-ga!") and his
   helmet does a backflip on his head. Immediately,
   Taran's cuts and bruises disappear.
   <p>
   "Wow, T, you look uglier than ever. Momma would
   be proud!" Jax slaps Taran on the back, resisting
   the urge to clap his hands simultaneously.
   <p>
   Above, heavy snorting and stomping is heard as
   the angry Rhino charges down the hall, finds no
   one to play with, then charges back the other way.

   Once again, Taran brings up the rear of the
   group and keeps an eye out for distant, yet
   easily blastable foes.
   <p>
   "By the way, Shippy, thanks for the juice. I

   and picks up the hobbit by the leg with one arm.
   With the other arm, torch in hand, he illuminates
   the wall. Shipy protests, but soon realizes his
   unique vantage point. Hanging upside down,
   he reads aloud: "Push here to open, push here to
   close, and if you keep pushing it you're going to
   break something."

   puts the hobbit down right side up, "it says what

   The comfortable and familiar feel of the weapon
   reassures him as he bravely heads back up the
   stairs. As soon as he can see into the room,
   he pauses to assess the situation.
   <p>
   [[Jax]] "What is up there?" Jax half-yells, half-
   whispers, from below.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "If you were up here I wouldn't be
   yelling down to you!" the hobbit responds. As
   Taran inches his way up the stairs, Shippy
   follows.
   <p>
   When the two of them reach ground level, they
   spy the room, which is empty. "You know if the
   Rhino sees the light, Taran, he's going to charge
   to it!" he whispers.
   <p>
   "Fine, then!" Taran mutters, and puts the torch
   down on the second step. They step into the
   room, switching to HotVision(TM). Proceeding
   further, they head to the door way, and peer
   down the hall. In the hallway
   are two ogres smashed into the floor where the
   tripwire was. Something large comes rumbling
   down the hall.
   <p>
   [[Taran]] With a knee-jerk reaction to large
   rumbling things heading his way, Taran let's
   loose with his crossbow. [L0SR vs. Dex: 6,3,
   seek enchantment works--sort of...] But at the
   last second, Shipy shouts, "No!", grabs the
   crossbow, and pulls it toward himself. The bolt
   tries to seek the intended target, but having
   not much room to magically maneuver, grazes
   Shipy's arm and thuds into the hallway wall.
   <p>
   Both orc and hobbit are stunned at each other's
   actions. Shipy grimaces and grabs his arm as if
   he's about to die (which he thinks he is).
   They're both confused, and then they wearily
   look up at the rhino which is now almost on
   top of them.
   <p>
   "Gulp!" says Taran.

   Yep, definitely not me. Forget the honorifics and flattery;
   `shield-monkey' sounds SO much better.

   ...and the following is what happened. I never post specific
   game information unless he gives it to me.]]
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Not wanting to wait for my lackey
   to returns, I climb the stairs to the
   half-way point and push the button Shipy spoke of not but a few minutes
   earlier.
   <p>
   "Oh Shippo, come here you smelly little hobbit!"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>

   How crass. I might THINK that, but I'd never say that aloud and
   possibly hurt the poor little blighter's feelings. He can't help what he is.
   Someday, I'm going to get him one of the Mutatum spells to fix that problem.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Before I can continue.
   Kopfy, Jax and my lustrous self
   disappear in a flash.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   592 - eickeric - 5/13/00 4:41 am
   <p>
   Am I more lustrous than the flash? And what were we bothering
   with torches for if I'm so lustrous? :)
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   All three of us were on the stairs or in the room
   at the bottom of the stairs. Shipy, Taran,
   and Lilac were up above somewhere.
