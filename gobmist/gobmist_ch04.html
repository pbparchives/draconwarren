   A thick unnatural mist continues to permeate the streets in all
   directions (moving into every location, be it alley way,
   side street or building), obscuring vision at more than twenty feet away.
   <p>
   [[Jax]] Climbing out and holding onto the rain gutter you start to descend,
   freezing in place as the two goblins round the corner of
   Hannibal's Sausage Shop below you. They each carry small pointed spears
   which seem to sparkle in the mist like little flares.  [[Taran]]
   trains his crossbow on them from above. Such any easy kill it would be at
   this point-blank range. The evil chuckling and snickering seems
   more like the two goblins are arguing. The two goblins turn into,
   four, six, and then eight as yet more goblins appear in pairs.
   <p>
   Considering your options the rain gutter suddenly comes loose from the
   building and you swing out away from the building. The snickering
   goblins seem to cover the noise the gutter makes, at least for the moment.
   [[Taran, if you make a level 2 SR against DEX, you can reach
   out and grab him. If you do you must put the crossbow down to do so.]]
   What do either of you do?
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Climbing up on the garbage
   can one of the three goblins pushes open the widow to Hannibal's
   Sausage Shop and climbs inside. The other two goblins pull the window
   back shut and march down the alley towards you! What do you do?
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] From the roof of Hannibal's Sausage Shop you observe both the
   goblins and the brothers Jax &amp; Taran’s problems. A moment
   later you see the a goblin exit the front of the building carrying
   sausages under either arm, having somehow gaining entry into the building.
   What do you do?
   <p>
   [[Shipy &amp; Kopfy]] Standing on his tippy-toes Shipy looks out of
   windowless window of the Abandon Building, peering out into the thick
   mist, but doesn’t see shit. Sitting on a crate Kopfy observes Shipy
   the Hobbit with a semi-bored sneer he usually has.

   "Ohhh, great." Jax winces at his predicament.
   "Shoulda realized this gutter had cliche written
   all over it!" Clinging on desperately (however
   else?) as the loosed gutter sways outward
   unsupported, Jax sees Taran struggle with
   indecision (or was it that sausage?).
   <p>
   Somewhere, down some dark and lonely alley in the
   misty night, some mead-sodden but musically
   inclined rogue is whistling the notes to
   "Abra-abra-cadabra, I wanna reach out and ..."
   <p>
   Jax hopes his trigger-happy bro takes the hint.

   [[Taran]] Putting his crossbow down he leans out as far out as
   the roof-top will allow him and grabs your extended wrist as you
   cling to the storm gutter like a incorrigible squirrel. Slowly
   he pulls you back to safety against the side of Hannibal's Sausage Shop,
   making little if any noise. [[Jax]] Below the large group of goblins
   enter the sausage shop en masse. With the goblins no longer below you,
   you effortless slide down the storm gutter and hop off noiselessly
   behind the water barrel like an apt thief. You hear continued rustling
   and evil snickering coming from inside Hannibal's Sausage Shop.
   Approaching from down the street you hear the footfalls of a dozen
   or more goblins coming directly towards you in the thick mist.
   You hear them long before you see them. What do you do next?
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Seeing the goblins approaching you,
   you whisper several arcane words of magic (translated to
   Khazanti tongue for our readers) "Whipper will and yellow snow,
   take me away with a Hidey Hole." Like a distant mirage on some desert
   you disappear (invisible) and the goblins march right past you unaware.
   Smiling you fall into step behind them, high-stepping and doing a
   mock salute.
   <p>
   <font color="red">[Editor's note: At this point and elsewhere
   in the adventure logs I
   have inserted some comments by the player behind the character Michael
   of the Midnight Magicks.  The player had been away for a while, and when
   he came back to the adventure, he wanted to comment on some of the things

   The two's loud footsteps, quiet down all the goblins still out in the open.
   It doesn't take the ork and hobbit to figure out that they aren't
   terribly alone. Instinctively the two delvers go back to back.

   Dozens of spear totting goblins circle the ork and hobbit who
   just happened to wander into their midst in the thick hanging mist, which
   seems to have thickened if such a thing is possible.
   As the threatening goblins circle you, you hear some type of command
   (Drel-ic-Nasif-Tobel’c) spoken in goblin tongue. Seconds later other
   sausage totting goblins rush past as if commanded to retreat.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] “We’re getting ready to die here and all I here is Shipo....
   its Shipy damnit!”
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Still (invisible) and having marched
   up within a dozen feet of the encircled Kopfy &amp; Shipy. You cup
   you hands over your mouth and shout “Dral-is-Nacif-Tabel’s.” It’s not
   exactly how previous goblin command sounded but its close enough you think.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] Being an ork you understand at least two of Michael’s
   shouted commands. (although you don’t know it’s Michael or see him).
   One was ‘Mother’ and one other was a degrading cuss word. What ever he
   said the goblins suddenly become enraged and attack you with
   wild abandonment!

  [[Jax]] Unsheathing your blade you take no more than two steps before
  you spin around at the twanging sound of a crossbow.
  No more than a few steps behind you, you see a goblin with a
  crossbow bolt sticking out of his head. Having an odd expression
  on his face the goblin collapses at you feet, and begins flopping like a
  fish out of water. His short spear still in hand, he intended to
  skewer you in the back.
  <P>
  [[Taran]] lifts his crossbow and smiles, and you smile back.

  [[Jax]] Rushing towards the fray with your weapon ready.
  As the mist parts to reveal the goblins, Kopfy, and Shipy you run
  head-long into the (invisible Michael). [Roll a Level 2 SR against DEX.

  [[Lilac]] Well above their heads you leave the roof of Hannibal's

  [[Shipy]] The first goblin steps forward and jabs wildly,
  missing the nibble hobbit. A second spear carrying goblin comes much
  closer, tearing his shirt beneath one arm.

   Jax had just survived a back-stab attempt (thanks T!),

   such a build-up of steam, but it was actually
   pretty cushy, and yelped like a soft, cuddly
   little kitten, but I digress.]]
  <p>
   As he tumbled up and over the unseen obstacle,
   Jax's mind raced to explain the phenomenon. As
   his massive form dissipated the impact by
   contorting itself into un-Orcly configurations as
   it arced through the mist, Jax retraced his steps, 
   going over and over the collision in his mind's
   eye. As his body reeled from the sudden departure 
   of its momentum into the dirt, Jax reached the
   conclusion that he was the target of very, very
   nasty, mean and vicious magick.<br>
   &lt;/SuperSloMo&gt;

   Jax yanks his tusks from the street and notices
   the deck of cards splayed out in disarray

   cruel 2-D mockery as his grandiose conclusion

   hobbit picking up the blade gingerly and admiring
   its balance.

   Beaming with pride, Jax shuffles the rope and
   hook back into his pack and accepts his
   EverSharp(TM) scimitar from Shipy. "Thanks,
   dude. I'll show you how it works next time, eh?"
  <p>
   As the mist clears, he wonders out loud in Taran's 
   general direction, "Now where'd those nasty
   goblins go?"

   [[ L3SR vs DEX: roll 3,6 = 9 + DEX(9)= 18.

   Taran realizes that the goblin has the drop on
   him just as the goblin fires his weapon. Taran
   takes a tumble to his left side in hopes that
   he will avoid the missile, and as he hits the
   ground he squeezes the release of his own bow.
   He counts on the magically 'seek' enhanced
   bolt to do what it was enchanted to do despite
   his maneuver (namely, hit on a L0SR on DEX).
  <p>
   [[ L0SR vs DEX: roll 1,1,2,3 = 7 + DEX(11) = 18.
   18 &gt; LS0R(15). Success--and hit if the magic
   does its job! ]]
  <p>
   As their bolts pass each other in mid flight,
   Taran wonders to himself whose blood decorates
   the crossbow of his foe, and wonders if his own
   blood will feel the dip of the incoming missile.

   With everyone standing together except Taran,
   Shipy adjusts his ripped shirt, looking around to see the
   mist has suddenly disappeared, returning everything to a
   normal night. Motioning to Lilac she glides in and lands
   effortlessly on my shoulder smiling.
  <p>
   "Being party leader all... ya think we are'd follow them?
   Might help if we were a bit more organized this time. The goblins headed
   back behind Hannibal's Sausage Shop. Where's Taran?"
  <p>
   "Good job Lilac," I say, looking at the pretty sprite.

   [[Taran]] You feel the wind from the goblin’s
   poisoned bolt as it passes inches from your face,
   missing its intended target. Even
   with the difficult maneuver your crossbow bolt still catches the
   goblin square in the chest lifting him off the rooftop and sending
   falling backwards off the building. Looking around you notice
   the mist has suddenly cleared and you are actually on the roof of
   Hannibal's Sausage Shop, not the Glittery Stuff Import
   Warehouse as you meant to be. You sign slightly,
   relieved to still be alive.
  <p>
   Turning the other direction you see all your comrades
   gathered out in the street in a huddle.

   Taran looks down at the gang below, relieved to
   see his brother and new companions still intact.
   He waves down at them and catches his brother's
   attention.
  <p>
   "All clear, bro?" Jax inquires in a hushed
   tone.
  <p>
   "Yep. Now, anyway," comes Taran's reply.
  <p>
   Taran brushes himself off, affixes his cranequin
   and cranks another bolt into the crossbow harness. 
   "So, we gonna follow 'em or not?" Taran begins
   again, trying to sound confident but at the
   same time trying to shake off his brush with
   poison death.

   [[GM]] Once all the dead goblins are searched (what few there are)
   a total of 4 gold, 1 copper, 1 light crossbow, 12 bolts, and
   two short spears are recovered. With everyone in somewhat
   of an agreement (except the part about Shipy being in charge) to
   follow the goblins all of you head towards the rear of Hannibal's
   Sausage Shop. There you find an open sewer grate.
  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] Looking up toward the rooftop Kopfy cups his hands and says
   "Come on down Taran and join us." Turning his
   attention towards the hobbit he points into the sewer and says,
   "You first Shipo... there might be a trap."
  <P>
   [[Shipy]] Swallows hard. "Me?" He notices Kopfy nodding yes with
   his head. With Lilac still standing on his shoulder Shipy
   heads down the metal rungs, inspecting each one as he continues downward
   into the bitch blackness. Minutes pass before
   everyone hears the hobbit say, "Ah shit!" and then the sound of
   Lilac giggling.
  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "Are you hurt?"
  <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Nah.. I stepped in shit. Avoid the third rung down from
   the top... its trapped. Come on down."

   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Having gathered up all his
   cards and reshuffled them Michael looks to everyone. "Who’s
   next?"
