   Looking up toward the rooftop Kopfy cups his
   hands and says "Come on down Taran and join us."

  <p>
   Taran makes one last HotVision(TM) scan of the
   streets visible from his perch on the roof
   before he descends to join the crew at the
   sewer grate. Given the close quarters the tunnel
   descent is likely to be, he secures his
   crossbow and attachment, closes the hood on
   his quiver, and falls into rank besides his
   brother. They exchange a glance of determination
   before descending.
  <p>
   "No use posting a sentry on the surface, seeing
   as they're all down the sewer, eh?" Taran
   muses. "Then again, one of 'em was up top with
   me so we shouldn't discount the fact that others
   are still topside."

   [[Lilac]] With my small silver inlaid ivory staff in hand I
   smack Shipy across the ear with it. He flinches slightly and I notice him
   giving me a hard stare. "What? It’s a light stick... I had to
   hit it against something. It worked didn’t?" I can’t help but notice Shipy
   rubbing his ear.
  <p>
   Holding up my staff it fills this area of the sewer with soft light.
   With the light I see Shipy and I are standing in oddly shaped (18 by
   18 foot) sewer union (shaped like a T), with three different tunnels
   going different directions. All three tunnels are 8 feet and 5 feet
   wide with two inch deep standing water in them. All three look exactly
   the same. Even the slightest noise echoes down the
   sewers. The metal rungs go 20 feet up to the open sewer grate.
  <p>
   Shipy is carefully not to stand under the metal rungs.
   Pushing my silver hair behind one ear Shipy and I wait for the others in
   silence.

   does tend to need my rescue over and over, I've clearly identified
   him as my lackwitted assistant ages ago. I don't play along with his
   delusions of grandeur, and don't think the others should encourage him
   either- it's likely to make the hobbit overestimate himself (quite an easy
   task, actually) and get himself killed. Help is too hard to

   [[GM]] Minutes pass before everyone has climbed down into the sewer,
   standing together. With Lilac’s light you see all of you
   are standing in oddly shaped (18 by 18 foot) sewer union
   (shaped like a T), with three different tunnels going different directions.
   All three tunnels are 8 feet and 5 feet wide with two inch deep standing
   water in them. All three look exactly the same. Even the
   slightest noise echoes down the sewers.
  <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Lock and people! And be ready for anything. Jax.... you’re
   in front, Taran, your in the back. Jax, I’ll be right behind
   you. Everyone else is in the middle. If you think something might need
   checked for traps... let me do it please."
  <p>
   Standing in the center of the group the short hobbit
   (not much taller than most of the group’s waist) looks up at everyone
   noticing they are all staring at him and swallows hard. "You know...
   if’n you want that is. Pick a tunnel Jax, and we’ll follow."
  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "Good job Shipo! Like I always said, you’d make someone a
   fine waiter some day," I say grinning widely.

  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] Coming from the passage straight ahead
   (not the right or left one) you hear the faintest rattling
   sound of a chain echoing up the sewer passage.
   You wonder if it is accidental or intentional. Looking to
   the one wall in this main sewer union you see three chalk
   scrawling’s on the wall. Understanding written
   goblin the first reads ‘You’ Moma’ sucks pond water’ a
   second message reads ‘The temple of the goblins mists sacrifices all’
   a third chalk message reads ‘For a good time contact slimy.’

   With little data to collect on a decision, Jax
   uses a lifeline: "Say, T, you've got a nose for
   trouble; which path smells best?"
  <p>
   Taran sloshes a bit near the graffiti-laden wall.
   In the wan light of Pnahk's enchanted mitre, Jax
   sees Taran aiming his sniffer down each passage.
   By the time his brother's sewer-water ripples reach Jax
   (under 60 seconds), he has his answer.
   "Straight ahead, bro. Neither left nor right.
   Up is right out."
  <p>
   Kopfy wades noisily past Shipy and taps Jax on his
   studded shoulder pad. "Just a minute ago, I
   heard some chain rattling that way, too."
  <p>
   Jax concurs, "Hmm. OK, then. Let's move
   straight ahead."
  <p>
   Michael queries, "Izzat your final answer?"

  <p>
   Jax sighs, and notes, half to himself, that last
   time Taran exercised his sniffer, joining up with
   Lerotra'hh's agents, he got himself turned into
   a lizard.
  <p>
   "Lizard? Where?" Lilac chimes in with a spritely
   smack of the lips.

   [[GM]] &lt;&lt; In the wan light of Pnahk's enchanted mitre&gt;&gt;
   Actually Pnahk is no longer with your group.
   He wandered off about the time the Goblin Mist moved in.
   Searching for his Mummy I think. The light
   source comes from Lilac’s tiny silver staff.
  <p>
   [[Jax]] With your scimitar drawn you proceed cautiously ahead.
   Shipy follows behind you, with Lilac on
   his shoulder, Kopfy behind him, Michael behind him,
   with Taran bringing up the rear. You walk steadily
   for a few uninterrupted minutes before you find a dead goblin
   in the center of the sewer passage. Rolling
   the naked goblin over with your foot you don’t see a mark on him.
   Pushing on his chest with your foot
   you suddenly realize the goblin drowned when greenish
   water erupts from his mouth.
  <p>
   Continuing on you come to a (20 by 20 foot) four-way sewer union
   (a crude map shown below). The
   floor of the room is covered with greenish water.
   Taking you [sic] sword you lean out and push it into the
   water, but don’t feel the bottom, so it’s at least waist deep or deeper.
   Shipy taps you on the back and
   you notice he is pointing at the ceiling. Hanging from the twenty
   foot high domed ceiling is a ten foot long
   length of chain with a circular ring on one end. Looking down each
   sewer passage (from your position)
   they all look the same. What do you do next?

  <p>
   [[Taran]] As you walk in the back of the group your
   keen ears hear a shuffling sound in the distance
   behind you. Every time you stop it stops.
   You do not see anything. What do you do?

   Sitting on hobby's shoulder,
   I retrieve a small piece of cloth and hold it up to my nose. "Geesh, no
   wonder goblins smell so bad, they need to change their bath
   water once in awhile!"
  <p>
   Watching Taran, I notice he stops after every few steps he
   takes and cocks his head as if listening to
   something. Poking Hobby's neck, I sliently hand him the ligt [sic] stick
   to hold and flutter to perch on Taran's shoulder.

  <p>
   [[Shipy]] Use to the over-eagerness of the sprite,
   I rub my neck and accept her tiny light stick. Holding
   it out above the green water filled room I notice the water
   moving in a circle ever so slightly. Startled I
   suddenly back into Kopfy, looking up and over my shoulder at
   the ork I call friend, and grin.
  <p>
   "Somethin' in there Kopfy, and I don't want to be bait!
   Remember, I have seven kids, a wife, two
   grandparents and a blind uncle to feed!"
  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "You're single Shippo, and you live alone!"
  <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Sheesh! Don't you think I know that Kopfy," I whisper. 
  <p>

  <p>
495 - jaxdracon - 4/26/00 8:27 am
  <p>
   Jax wipes his brow with a meaty fist. "Sheesh.
   There's always gotta be something in the water;
   first jellyfish, then a giant crocodile, and now
   this!" he mutters.
  <p>
   "Wazzat, Jax?" Shipy pipes.
  <p>
   "Oh, nothing," Jax responds, a bit embarrassed.
   "I just don't have much luck with water-filled
   rooms. Say, do the left and right corridors have
   floors? Maybe we could avoid this junction
   altogether by hopping over it. You or Kopfy check 
   the left; I'll poke my sword down on the right,
   but don't step into the junction!"
  <p>
   As he wades toward the right corridor, Jax has a
   nagging suspicion about the ring suspended halfway 
   up from the domed ceiling... DOMED ceiling....
   Could this be the goblin's temple?
  <p>
   Kopfy seems to pick up on Jax's thoughts: "If we
   pull that ring, something bad will probably
   happen."
  <p>
   "Hmmm," Jax muses. Taran might be able to fire
   a bolt attached to some silk cord through the
   ring. But where would that get them?
  <p>
   "Oh I dunno, maybe if we pull the ring, all this
   yucky water will drain away," Michael of the MM
   offers optimistically,
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   543 - eickeric - 5/5/00 10:33 am

   Taran whispers to Lilac nonchalantly,
   so as not to arouse the suspicion of anyone in the group--or
   anyone following them. "I keep hearing some kind of echo from behind us.
   It stops when we do," he says.
  <p>
   [[ L1SR on Int (I use doubles roll over rule as KStA taught
   me): 3,3,3,5=14 + Int(9) = 23. Made it!]]
   Then, Taran shrewdly considers,
   "I suppose the echoing only could actually be our own sloshing, which
   is why it would stop when we stop, but then again,
   if I were following someone, I'd want to synchronize our steps to mask them."
  <p>
   Lilac looks at the orc and tilts her head. "I'm impressed.
   I thought all you had in that head of yours was
   tusk!" "And ear wax," she thinks to herself.
  <p>
   Taran continues, slightly blushing at the large tusk compliment:
   "What say a couple of us hang back
   around the corner of the intersection and see if anyone really
   is following us? Don't want to send you down there by your lonesome."
  <p>
   Lilac's eyes widen. "Then if someone is following us,
   we can 'blast 'em?'"
  <p>
   Taran nods. "Ajup. Or, we could skip straight to the blasting
   part and send a flamed bolt
   [[ one of Taran's seek enchanted bolts,
   although I'm not sure the enchantment works if he can't see who
   he's firing at--this was never specified by Ken ]] down back the hall
   in the direction of the dead guy."
   He jerks his right thumb behind him. "If someone is back there,
   we'd definitely hear them sloshing to get outta the way."
  <p>
   The unlikely plotters slosh to the rest of their group to
   discuss their machinations just in time to hear
   Michael and Jax's ponderings about draining the intersection's puddle.

   Climbing off into the green mucky water you
   find it to be about waist deep and very cold. Quickly you
   cross to the room toward the right sewer passage,
   keeping close to the wall. Just as you move to within
   reach of the passage a Water Weird raises up beside you,
   mimicking your face and body exactly. The
   creature appears to be made of solid water.
   The creature turns its head sideways and smiles at you. 
  <p>
   You now realize what killed the goblin and why you
   hate rooms filled with water. You stand motionless
   looking face to face with the creature who doesn’t
   seem to be evil or angry at the moment. What do
   you do or say?
  <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] "I could freeze the

   Dis-Spell on the sewer passage, still hovering above
   Taran. The corridor suddenly shimmers and then is
   instantly filled with spear toting goblins. Raising their
   spears they charge! You easily count twenty. What do you do?

   is loaded, aims, and fires at one of the incoming
   hoarde. [[ L0SR vs Dex: 2,2,1,3 = 7 + Dex(11) =

   aim to be true, he backs up a bit toward the
   others and reaches for another bolt to crank into
   his bow.

   "Incoming!!!" he speaks nervously to the rest,
   not eager to startle the water creature, but
   quite eager to alert his brother and the crew
   of the situation down the sewer.

   [[GM]] - Lilac... as you delay in not answering
   the game continues onward. A simple 'I cast a spell' or
   do this or that would help.
  <p>
   [[Jax]] The Water Weird’s smile turns to that of a frown.
   Raising one arm up, which holds a water
   sword it points toward the left passage. "You go wrong way friend,"
   it says in a bubbly orkish voice.
   Disappearing into the green water,
   the water around you boil as something grabs you from below,
   lifting you up almost out of the water
   (except for your ankles and shoes) and carries you across the
   room at high speed, releasing you into the left passage.
   Nervously surprised at the action you salute the
   Water Weird and it raises up (still looking exactly like you)
   and smiles.
  <P>
   [[Taran]] Your first shot passes straight through the
   chest of the closest goblin as he charges you, but
   doesn't seem to harm it. Having little time to react
   and no where to retreat the goblins charge en masse.
   With a perfect attack the first goblin stabs you in the
   right thigh (take 8 hits), as the barbed spear tip
   passes straight through the meaty part of your right leg.
   The goblin holds onto the spear which in turn
   holds you. Blood pours from the wound. You cry out in pain.
   There are five goblins facing you, with
   more behind them. It’s your turn, what do you do!
  <P>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Hearing the noise,
   Michael spins around and steps up beside.
   "Holy sheep sheerer... what’s going on Taran?"

   I got someone's name correct?!? Amazing.

   Raising his hands he prepares a spell.

  <p>
   Jax snaps a swift salute to the grinning
   doppelgänger in amazement. "Wow, thanks! What a
   trip, man! Hey, Taran, didya see---"
  <p>
   But Jax's astonishment quickly melts into worry
   when he hears both the twang of his brother's
   crossbow and his ensuing yelp, nearly squelched
   in the furious sloshings of many feet---goblin
   feet, he surmised. Suddenly, Jax connects the
   ripples, the dead goblin, and the mysterious
   living liquid.
  <p>
   Jax timidly readdresses his watery reflection.
   "Say, good sir, it sounds like my friends could
   use some help. Might I have permission to cross
   back through your domain again? I promise not to
   make too many waves, like those confounded
   goblins."

   [[Jax]] Asking passage back across the
   putrid water from the Water Weird, it motions at the water, and
   the water sets up like stone in a narrow walkway
   from the left sewer passage back to your original
   passage. "I will hold the crossing for a short time,"
   bubbles the Water Weird, lowering back into the
   water. Quickly you race across the magical walkway and it holds firm.

   [[Shipy The Cunning]] Caught between the Water
   Weird and the attacking goblins I stand paralyzed
   with fear (as only a hobbit can), not quite deciding
   what to do next.
  <p>
   Putting one hand in my mouth stops my chattering teeth.
   I never expected being party leader would be so hard!

  <p>
   "Thank you again! Should only take a minute!"
   Jax replies over his shoulder, as he races across
   the frozen bridge.
  <p>
   Wading between Shipy, who appears to be fishing
   something out of his mouth, and Michael, who
   is revving up a spell with grandiose flourishes,
   Jax finally joins Taran and Lilac, now tackling
   the goblins face-to-face.
  <p>
   As he swings his EverSharp(TM) scimitar at the
   goblin who speared his brother, he hopes Michael
   has good aim, or that Kopfy beats him to the punch 
   again using a *real* spell.
  <p>
   Lilac buzzes past, doppler-shifting her tinny
   voice, "What took you so long?"

   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] With is hands raised
   Michael speaks several ancient words of power (Translated for the readers)
   "Mites and miters, thistles in the wind, send me some arrows to
   damage these little men!" With that dozens of arrows fly
   out of Michael’s finger tips passing harmlessly
   through all the goblins within the sewer passage.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>

   Beats the heck out of me what that was, but I liked it.
   <hr></blockquote>
  <p>
   [[Kopfy]] With a twist of his wrist and a single
   word of power the ork-sage/wizard casts a spell. All of
   the goblins within the corridor instantly disappear in a
   brilliant flash, like gunne powder being tossed on a
   lit torch. "Illusions... and powerful ones at that,"
   explains Kopfy a few moments later. "I suspect they
   come from an item nearby... maybe the Goblin Temple itself."
  <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Clapping his
   hands together Michael says, "Worry not daring
   duo.... (patting both brothers on the back),
   I took care of all the goblins for you!"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   544 - eickeric - 5/5/00 10:51 am
   <p>
   1) Don't applaud yourself. It's vulgar.
   2) It looks weird to clap your hands together when back patting anyway.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Smiling widely and proud of his ability.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   544 - eickeric - 5/5/00 10:51 am

   Justly so.

  <p>
   [[Taran]] Looking down at the once wicked wound
   you see it is now gone, as are the goblins. You still
   feel slightly stunned by the event.
  <p>
   [[Jax]] The moment you rushed up beside your
   brother and swung your EverSharp(TM) scimitar was
   the exact instant the goblins disappeared.
  <p>
   [[Shipy]] Pushing his way into the crowd the hobbit
   says, "Okay people, let’s get moving... the show it
   over! Chop, Chop, people!"

   Jax beams back, "Right, then. Good show,
   Michael!" Then rolling his eyes and addressing
   Kopfy in a lower voice, "Thanks buddy, that would
   have been embarrassing!"
  <p>
   Turning to Taran, still stunned, Jax asks, "Shake
   it off, dude. You'll live, T."
  <p>
   "I---I KNEW it was an illusion!" Taran stammers.
  <p>
   Then Jax spoke to his comrades, "Everybody,
   Shipy's right, we've got to cross the Water
   Wierd's bridge---he can't hold it up for much
   longer! To the left!"

   IC: I was amazed when the goblins disapear and
   Kopfy (I think was him) stated that they were illusions.
   "Wow" I think to myself "Wish I could do stuff like that.
   Think of all the neat stuff I could magik up." 
  <p>
   Giggling softly to myself as visions of gaint [sic]
   sun-dried lizards dance in my head, I miss the conversation
   and am rudely gounced out of my day dream to find
   everyone heading over the Water Werid at a fast
   pace. Once on the other side, I fly over to Hobby,
   I land back on his shoulder.
  <p>
   In my sweetest little voice (as only a sprite can do =P )
   I adress [sic] Hobby. 
  <p>
   "Oh brave and couragous [sic] party leader,
   may I kindly have my light stick back now?"

  <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Of course you can have your light stick back
   'PRINCESS' Lilac!" Smiling I hand over her
   silver inlaid ivory staff as she lands lightly on my shoulder. 
  <p>
   An image of beauty even in poor lighting with the wit
   of a carrage [sic] driver, I think to myself.

  <p>
   [[Jax]] With everyone following behind you,
   all of you cross the magical (if not temporary) bridge
   created by the Water Weird. Cautiously you continue
   your advance down the left sewer passage. (Lilac
   speeds away and returns during this time, see next post)
   After traveling about 75 feet you see a fourway
   intersection up ahead. Suddenly Shipy jabs you in the
   back with his pudgy finger (as only a hobbit can).
  <p>
   [[Shipy]] "If’n you take one more step forward Jax
   you’re gone’a fall in a pit!" says Shipy, whispering
   from behind you. "Trust me big slayer... its there!"
  <p>
   [[Jax]] Looking down you see nothing but a normal sewer floor.
