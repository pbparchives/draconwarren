    [[OOC - Laimia_Best posing as Misfitsprite until she posts in her own
    stead. This sounds like one of those soap opera’s (giggles).]]
    <p>
    [[Lilac]] With my light staff in hand I leave Shipy’s shoulder on a
    quick scouting sortie (buzzing Jax as I depart), heading down the left
    sewer passage. Keeping up next to the eight foot high ceiling. Following
    the corridor for over a hundred feet I pause at a fourway intersection.
    The passage straight ahead is collapsed, the passage to the left ends in a
    smooth stone wall. I quickly turn down the right passage. It ends a bit
    later in a square squalid (20 by 20 foot) room with a large pile of
    refuse in one corner. A sewer inlet leads up the back wall. Zipping
    upwards towards it I quickly find it has been cobblestoned over ages ago.
    Pirouetting in the air I speed back down the passage widst I came.
    About midway down the first corridor I notice a trip wire stretched across
    the passage. Pausing only a moment to take note of it, I continue back to
    Shipy’s shoulder as fast as my tiny wings will carry me.
    <p>
    Landing safely back on Shipy’s shoulder I relate my entire scouting
    mission verbatim, also showing the party my crude sprite drawn map so far.

   Jax freezes in mid-stride. The small waves
   generated by the party propagate silently
   in the putrid sewer water as a smattering of
   ever-expanding circles, crossing the so-called
   pit effortlessly and without effect.

   "If you say so, Shipy; how can you tell?" But
   Shipy's response is delayed by the arrival of

   Jax is awed by the faerie's artwork! But his
   attention soon returns to the task at hand. "I
   need info, Shipy. What else can you make of the
   pit?" Jax moves to the nearest wall and
   carefully prods the floor with his foot.

    [[Jax]] Prodding the floor with your foot causes the stone work pit to
    unexpectedly to drop open, causing the shallow water within the passage
    to flow into the pit. Leaning forward you see a twenty foot deep pit lined
    with teeth-like three foot long iron spears. You also see a skeleton
    amongst the water a debris. A narrow ledge allows access past the pit along
    the right side.

   Steadying himself as the sewer water rushes past,
   down into the newly-revealed pit, Jax is thankful
   for the luck o' the Hobbit. "You nailed that one,
   Shipy!"
    <p>
   Lilac buzzes overhead, circling the pit and its
   unlucky denizen. "Oooh! That had to hurt!"
    <p>
   "Good bye and good riddance!" Michael quips...

   <blockquote><hr>

   <p>
   "Whaddaya say we all head over to that trash heap
   Lilac's discovered?" Jax offers. Not waiting for
   an answer, Jax sheaths his blade, heads over to
   the right side of the pit, flattens his right jowl 
   against the wall, and carefully begins to walk
   across the narrow ledge with his arms spread wide, 
   hugging the wall. "By the tusks of Arahk Gnahk,
   I've got to lose some weight!"

    Peaking over the edge of the foul smelling pit I look inside and turn
    up my nose in disgust. Nibbly I climb past the pit on the wrong side
    (clinging to the wall like a spider) as Jax slowly edges across the ledge
    like a cave-man on a tight-rope.

   "Hmm, you're right. It's worth a look-see," Jax
   says to the moldy bricks of the sewer wall. Not
   surprisingly, they don't talk back.
    <p>
   Jax speaks again, "Say, Shipy, I'll meet you at
   the other side and then lower you down with my
   rope. You can sniff for gold down there to your
   Hobbit's heart's content!"
    <p>
   Lilac buzzes by Jax on her way over to the Hobbit,
   who was adeptly scaling the sewer walls like a hairy spider.
   ("Sheesh, I hate it when she does
   that!") Her high-pitched giggle echoed off the
   walls.
    <p>
   "Hey Hobby, can I come too? Pretty-please?? You
   might need my light stick!"

   Taran starts across the ledge after his brother.
   "I for one will stay above and watch for visitors.

   passageway both from whence they came and further
   ahead before distracting himself with cranking
   another bolt into his crossbow.
   <p>
   Glancing down into the pit at the doomed
   once-adventurer, he wonders aloud, "At least

   [[Shipy]] "If’n you’re gone’a lower me into that foul pit, I’ll be tying
    my own knots Jax. Your sheep shank knot just doesn’t cut it." Quickly a
    rig up my own harness and secure it before allowing Jax to lower me into
    the dank spear lined pit. "I’m supposed to be party leader, not bait on
    a rope!" By then Jax had already lowered me to the bottom of the pit,
    a wry smile on his face. I notice more than a few others are smiling
    as well. Lilac hovers
    above, her light stick illuminating the pit thoroughly.
    <p>
    Running my hands over the skeleton, and into the putrid water around it I
    find a small leather pouch (with the top tied) about the size of Jax’s
    meaty fist (it seems filled, the pouch that is). I also find a rusted
    falchion and an ivory wand with a small black button on it. Searching
    everywhere else I find nothing. "Up Jax... I’m finished... Jax?
    Jax?" I look upward, my future depending on Jax.

   "Heh. Right-o, bro. Sheep shank knot, indeed.
   Those knots got me up one mile to Gristlegrim,
   buddy!" Jax hurls the last words down the pit as
   he pulls the Hobbit upwards.

   Once Shipy is safely out of the pit, Jax loops up
   his rope, asking, "So let's see what Bones had on

   [[Kopfy]] "My magical energies are all but expended.

   bucket of water.
   <p>
   [[GM]] As Shipy raises up near the halfway mark (lifted by Jax)
   Lilac glides down into the pit and lands on Shipy’s shoulder smiling and
   looking at the new found loot. Without warning the six inch thick hinged
   stonework lid (which dropped into the pit) suddenly snaps up shut in less
   than a second. It instantly cuts the rope, dropping
   Shipy back into the pit, and trapping Lilac and Shipy inside the pit.
   Everyone in the sewer passage above is suddenly cloaked in darkness.
   No sound can be heard from within the pit over Michael’s screeching.

   The sudden snapping of his rope causes Jax to
   stumble backward and fall on his rump. "Ooof!
   What the.... Who turned out the lights?"
   <p>
   With trained reflex, Jax's nictitating membranes
   snap open as he speaks. He immediately notices
   that he cannot see the heat signatures of Shipy or 
   Lilac. But worse, he has a hard time making out
   the others as well. "T, Kopfy, how's your
   HotVision(TM)?" Jax nurses a nagging suspicion
   that the sewer gas is interfering.
   <p>
   As Taran grunts in astonishment, Kopfy responds,
   "Blurry! And I can't pick up Shippo 'n' Sprite;
   they must be trapped inside the pit!"
   <p>
   Jax fishes around in his pack, feeling for some
   matches, but cannot find any. "Frak! Must've
   thrown 'em out after the jellyfish soaked 'em.
   T, tell me you still have some matches!"
   <p>
   Taran finally gets a word in edgewise, between
   Michael's screeches, "Mike...MIKE!! Cool your

   erstwhile pit, hoping to activate the door again.

   marbles, or in this case, exactly like an orc
   with a mouth full of tusks. "Surely if Jax
   tripped the pit once, and Mr. Bones down there
   tripped it once before, then we can trip it
   again."

   "Unless there's some kind of enforced time period
   between trips," Jax adds, "which to me wouldn't
   make much sense. Surely the crafters of this pit
   would want to maximize the tripping of their trap."
   <p>
   "Maximum trippage yields maximum trappage,"
   Kopfy thinks to himself with a smirk.

   [[Jax]] Dropping a rope to the hobbit you quickly pull Shipy
   up out of the pit to safety. Even wounded he still

   Amused, but maintaining a grave focus, Taran

   I examine Taran's binding wounds skills a little later. Looking
   around for more sympathy I wait until everyone's
   attention is focused back on the sewer passage and then I pull out a small
   potion vial from my pocket and drink it's contents. Something a hobbit
   should never be without... healing. My wound suddenly heals and disappears.
   The potion doesn't fix my silk shirt or get rid of all the blood. 
   <p>
   Turning to Kopfy, I snatch the pouch out of his hand as the group
   continues on to the fourway.

   "Of course you're not gonna go and die on us. We don't wanna carry
   your body in these sewers cause you'll start to smell worse then they do!"
   I scold the overacting hobbit. "Besides, what are we gonna do if our party
   leader goes and croaks on us at the begining of the campaign?"
   <p>
   I look to the party members, "So, what now fellas?"

   Looking over my shoulder at Jax, I whisper, "What

   Jax looks up at the faerie after tying the square
   knot the correct way. A nice sun-dried lizard
   *would* be good about now.... He whispers back,
   "Well, I'd like to say it's just a flesh wound,
   Lilac, but then, as you noticed, I had to stuff
   some intestines back inside.... Still, Taran and
   I've seen worse."
   <p>
   Then, to the group: "He'll make it---look at how
   he grips his loot! This Hobbit's a fighter, if
   I've ever seen one!"
   <p>
   Then, to Kopfy and Mike, much softer: "Either of
   you got enough juice left for a healing spell?"

   <hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Jax turns back to the oozing Hobbit, and does a
   double take: the wound is gone! He doesn't
   notice that Kopfy and Mike are as amazed as he is.

   <p>
   "Wow, guys, that was quick! Good show!" Jax
   remarks obliviously.
   <p>
   Kopfy says with a smirk as Shipy snatches the
   pouch from his hand, "Right. Whatever. Now
   off to the right folks. Let's check out the trash 
   heap. We can figure out what the wand does
   later."
   <p>
   "Watch the trip-wire!" Lilac cautions, buzzing
   ahead of Jax.

   Khara_Khang...(continues)
   <p>
   [[GM]] Following the sewer passage to the fourway,
   everyone turns right and continues on, making a point to
   step over the trip wire about midway between the fourway
   and the sewer union beyond. The sewer passage
   ends a bit later in a square (20 by 20 foot) room with a
   large pile of refuse in one corner. A sewer inlet and steel
   rungs lead up the back wall. A quick check reveals it has been
   cobblestoned over ages ago, just as Lilac stated.
   Except for the trash pile in one corner, the room is dry and
   moderately clean. Shipy, Michael, and Kopfy sit
   down in one corner and rest. Lilac glides in effortlessly and
   lands on Shipy’s shoulder, pulling on his ear and
   scolding him. No one hears what she says except the hobbit.
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Accepting the ivory wand from
   Kopfy after being offered a look, Michael
   turns it over looking at every inch of it. (It’s about two foot long,
   white, with a single black button.) For some
   reason people scurry out of the way which ever direction Michael points it.
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>

   Obviously, it's a wand of avoidance. Look at folks run.

   "Very cool, I can’t wait to use it in
   combat. I love zapping stuff!"
   <p>
   <blockquote><hr>
   545 - eickeric - 5/5/00 11:16 am
   <p>
   Combat? Why wait that long?
   Fire the thing at Shippo and see what it does,
   that's what I hired him for! Hobbits have LOTS of health.
   No, on second thought, better not. Fireblossom is probably resting on
   his shoulder again. No sense losing two people. Point it down the corridor
   and press the button.
   <hr></blockquote>
   <P>
   "Plus it feels real smooth!" says Michael,
   smiling and stroking his wand.

   [[Kopfy]] "I detect a resplendent summoning power, one of indeterminate
   in origin, with no predetermined
   circumscribed manipulation. An untested application may result in
   unanticipated circumstances for everyone
   involved. Of course that’s just my theorem," explains Kopfy,
   in a way few could understand. Leaning back
   against the wall he closes his eyes.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] Gaining his best voice as only a hobbit can, he says,
   "Okay people, listen up, we’ll stay here for about
   five hours and let our so-called wizards get some rest. Everyone relax
   and have some food and drink. I hope
   one of you thought enough to bring me some! First off, anyone want this
   rusted falchion...? Kopfy said it didn’t
   show up as magical. I thought we’d let the wizards carry the wand if
   no one objects." Dumping the contents of
   the pouch out on the floor in front of him the hobbit counts 22 gold lions,
   16 silver eagles, 3 rubies, and one
   large emerald (party treasure). Eyeing the gems closely under Lilac’s
   light he says, "The emerald is worth
   roughly 312 gold, and the rubles are worth about 105 gold each,
   give or take a few gold pieces, and I’m never
   wrong about these things. Jax, you and your brother have done an excellent
   job so far, especially the part where
   you saved my life and bound my wounds... I thank you!" Shipy fakes a
   slight chest pain for sympathy.

   Interesting. Look likes things heated up the day after I disappeared.
   Go figure. Still likely to be gone for a while,
   I'll arrive in Japan in June, and should have computer access regularly
   again there.
   <p>
   I was going to simply have MMM wander off, but wasn't able to post
   that before I went. Good thing I didn't, it's
   pretty clear he's been the power of the group so far. *Ahem*
   <p>
   No real complaints to whomever has been running him in the meantime,
   quite good actually, more or less- just a
   few comments that probably went through his head. So to everyone:
   Ignore the following messages if you like,
   since they make absolutely no difference in the actual game.
   (Especially since most of these scenes are LONG gone.)
   <p>
   <font color="red">[Editor's note: I have inserted Eickeric's comments
   in their appropriate places earlier in the story segments.  Since he
   missed out as it was being written, it seemed only fair to interject
   his humorous and correctional posts regarding his character's actions in
   his absence.  No doubt you have seen them by now.]</font>

   Overall, looks great everyone; I can't wait until I can actually get
   involved. Too bad we lost poor pnakh, I
   TOLD you guys that discrimination against dead things was a bad idea.

   Well we had to do something while he was away!
   Glad to have you back, eickeric, and sorry
   if we got MMM wrong, but I sure enjoyed reading
   your critiques. Had me lol in the office, and
   people were starting to look at me funny.
   <p>
   It is kind of awkward to write exclusively about
   one character in game posts, however, so I hope
   people don't mind if I occasionally put words in
   their character's mouth. We can always "edit that 
   part out later," as tarandracon would say.
