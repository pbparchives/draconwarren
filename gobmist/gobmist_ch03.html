   Switching positions about a hundred different times, I decide the roof is too hard for me so I fly around the lamplight a
   few times instead of pacing and think to myself...
<p>
   "Where in the heck is everyone... and they alwaz say girls are alwaz the late ones.." mutter... mutter... mutter...
<p>
   Sighing, I sit on a tree branch right above the light and watch the streets for my new compains.

   Deciding the time was right, I leave my hiding spot and cross the street stopping next to the lamp post. Smiling, I looking
   up into the tree above noticing Lilac. 
<p>
   Rubbing my smooth Hobbit chin I say, "Is that you Lilac? It's me... Shipy The Cunning! I thought you were a pigeon there
   for a moment." I snicker slightly as only Hobbits can.
<p>
   "Where are the others?" I ask, looking to and fro.

364 - pnakh - 3/17/00 8:31 am
<p>
   Pnakh steps less than nimbly from the shadows, through the puddles into the lamplight. With an oilskin about his shoulders,
   covering him down to his gumboots, and a sowester on his head, he looks and smaells like a sailor that has had a
   particularly nasty accident.
<p>
   "'Lo", he mutters. "Where's these sewers then, I'm tired of being propositioned by the seamen of these parts."

366 - Kopfy - 3/18/00 2:17 am
<p>
   From the Daily Troll Planet Guildpress, across the street from the Ice Factory, Kopfy walks out. Shrill and whinning
   voices are heard behind him, with one person speaking loudly to calm everyone down, as he shuts the door. The ork
   smiles at himself.
<p>
   'Took out one in the fist fight.'He thinks to himself.
<p>
   Seeing Shipy, Pnakh, and Misfit by the lamp post he remembers that he has to earn the 20 golds he made last night. He
   sees the Orcish brothers and the human warrior walking up from different streets.
<p>
   "Hullo Shipo, Peter, and Miss Prissy." He says in greeting, trying his best to sound leaderly.

   (GM note: As this is my first Play By Post adventure and there is more than adventurer involved, I am not going to create
   how your characters interact with each other. And once a tone a set I will add details to move the plot along.
<p>
   Getting to the dungeon crawl is tricking when you have players who beam to the start point and stand off in the distance
   mutely. This isn't the one on one of a PBEM; but like like a cooperative effort in most literary roleplaying pieces.)
<p>
   [Taran and Jax were transported to this land/dimension and took up some kind of guard job to get a bit of fundage.]
<p>
   (GM statement: sounds fine to me. Don't know anything about the Balrog you've been dealing with or the sealed; and
   whoever you're stating this for can jump in and run that part of the adventure for you. I can appreciate continuity.)

376 - tarandracon - 3/20/00 4:02 pm
<p>
   Taran and his elder brother Jax approached the gathered kindreds in silence. They weren't sneaking, necessarily, but they
   knew that their delightful orcish scent would precede them, so they didn't bother to announce themselves. They could tell
   their arrival was expected anyway when the fairy flew down from her looking post and alerted the rest of the groundlings
   of the newcomers.
<p>
   "So, basically we decided we were gonna help you out on your Goblin hunt," offered Taran, proudly.
<p>
   Jax harumphed a bit, noting the magic-heavy group before him, and rearranged his lips a bit around his protruding canines.
   Trying not to sound too superior in his intellect, and also trying to hide his distaste that the others considered the hobbit
   their leader, he added, "Yeah, I'm sure you could use a bit more steel. Heh. My pesky brother and I heard all about it at
   the bar last night. If you'll cut us in on an equal share of the pay, rest assured we'll do our fair share of cutting, too."
<p>
   "And sticking," Taran finished, hefting his crossbow over his shoulder. "So, where's our contact? He's almost late!" 
<p>

378 - Kopfy - 3/21/00 2:38 am
<p>
   Kopfy looks around at everyone. And wonders where did anyone assume Shipy the Hobb was the leader and wonders
   they consider 'magic heavy' considering they just walked out of an environment where they needed a 'permanent' vorpal
   blade. But he isn't surprised at the other two orks, Capt. Horus had sent a message along with an over due light bill, about
   the two "Orcs."
  <p> He nods at Michael and hails his kindred in Yithian.
<p>   "I know your sister and mother." Kopfy says in time-honored greeting to them. 
  <p> He then looks around at still run down neighborhood around them.
<p>   "According to my astrological calcuations (looking at a map and marking off the places where the goblins hit before...)this
   is where the goblins are going to hit tonoght." He gestures around them.
  <p> "We post ourselves around here. Find out which hole they dive into and follow them home. Simple enough." The ork
   smiles, "We split the treasure as we need to. And if we get to the bottom of this, there will be a bonus."
<p>   He looks at Shippy.
<p>
(Okay kiddos goto:

380 - hobbit_king - 3/21/00 8:44 am
<p>
   Kopfy looks around at everyone. And wonders why did anyone assume Shipy the Hobb was the leader.
<p>
   "Damn ork maids, telling everyone I was the party leader and all, you just can't trust them now days!" An enigmatic smile
   appears on my face.
<p>
   Kopfy says, "We post ourselves around here. Find out which hole they dive into and follow them home. Simple enough."
   The ork smiles, "We split the treasure as we need to. And if we get to the bottom of this, there will be a bonus." He looks
   at Shippy.
<p>
   "What?" I say, noticing Kopfy staring at me. "I knew you would agree with my plan Kopfy, that and to check out that
   rundown building." I point my chubby Hobbit finger toward it. "If'n I were a goblin I'd expect I'd crawl out of it
   somewhere you know."
<p>
   Rubbing the wrinkles out of my shirt I look around at the gathered adventurers, noticing them eyeing me sharply. Gulping
   hard I smile showing them my small white Hobbit teeth.

381 - Kopfy - 3/21/00 10:35 am
<p>
   Kopfy just knew the plans wouldn't include the sausage shop.
<p>
   "Uh yeah. Sure sounds best to me. You and I will go over there." He says resigned to not having a late night snack,
   though hobbit does smell good...
<p>
   Shakes his head and rememebers what his mother sticking his face in mud, 'Don't eat yur friends Yam-Hunter!!!!' He
   remembers wistfully.
<p>
   (Everyone else if you could break of in twos or threes?) 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
383 - tarandracon - 3/21/00 12:00 pm
<p>
   Taran and Jax acknowledged the native ork's greeting about their mother and sister with a pair of satisfied grunts. Then
   they, too, looked in on the map, trying to concentrate on the objective at hand. It would be easy to get lost in thought about
   their far away home, and their parents.
<p>
   "So let me get this straight," Taran began. "We're going to hide and watch this area," he continued, waving his mug of a
   hand over the scribbled map, "until these miscreants show up?"
<p>
   Kopfy nodded.
<p>
   "Then what, we just let 'em get away? Why not just blast 'em?"
<p>
   Jax sighed. "We need to find out where they're coming from, ya lunk head," he retorted, slapping his brother upside the
   back of his greasy head. "If we take 'em out here, we'll never know where they came from."
<p>
   "Right." Taran nodded as he comprehended the plan, but mumbled to himself nontheless, "I still say we blast maybe just a
   few of them."
<p>
   Kopfy spoke up. "You'll get your chance to let loose the hounds of your _mighty_ crossbow," he noted, stressed "mighty"
   a bit sarcastically.
<p>
   Taran looked appeased. Jax looked at the map, and smudged a spot near the "Glittery Stuff Import Ware House." They
   both looked delightfully ugly. "My greasy brother and I will scope out this structure. He'll go topside and get a storm
   crow's-eye view," Jax said, noticing that Pnakh didn't even flinch at the name of the beasts that ended his life--at least an
   alternate dimension version of his life, "and I'll wander around ground level, staying in the shadows, of course."
<p>
   The rest of the group nodded. Taran spoke up again. "You sure we're just gonna let 'em go?"
<p>
   "Maybe tusk-face is right," the sprite spoke up. "We might have fun if we captured one of 'em." She batted her eyelids
   innocently. "I promise, I'll be nice."
<p>
   Amid chuckles from the group, Taran's visage betrayed that he liked the sound of that. Jax pondered and his dirty green
   brow furled. "Well? Could be interesting." Jax glanced at the rest of the group assembled. "Where are the rest of you
   going to secret yourselves?" 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">

386 - misfitsprite - 3/21/00 5:13 pm
<p>
   Humming to myself, I fly out of the tree and hover over the group watching the streets. 
<p>
   "I'll take the Wicker basket factory."
<p>
   I perch myself on Shipy's shoulder "you lead the way Shipo, I'm just along for the ride"

387 - eickeric - 3/21/00 6:27 pm

   Well, how unfortunate to have split off and left the poor mummy all alone. Yet another example of the prejudice against
   dead folks... they really need a better lobbying organization.
<p>
   "Hey, Pnankh- I'm going to stake out the bookstore. Feel free to come along, and learn a few things. Such as my `open
   locks' spell- I'll need a big rock for the material component though..."

<P>
388 - hobbit_king - 3/21/00 10:09 pm
<p>
   Kopfy says to me, "Uh yeah. Sure sounds best to me. You and I will go over there." Looking at me as if I was some type
   of snack. Of course I know he would never do that to the party leader.
<p>
   Lilac glides in and lands on my shoulder. In her sweet little sprite voice she says, "you lead the way Shipo, I'm just along
   for the ride."
<p>
   If only I could believe such soft spoken words. I smile raising one eyebrow as only a Hobbit can. With Kopfy at my side
   and Lilac on my shoulder we cross the street and enter the ruined building.

390 - pnakh - 3/22/00 11:37 am
<p>
   Pnakh shrugs under his oilskin, and plucks a fair sized loose cobble from off the street, which he hands over to his
   companion.
<p>
   Then, affecting a drunken roll, he heads over towards the bookstore, elaborately clears a small area of garbage, sits down
   and pulls out a bottle of brown liquid (water).

   "What a peach. What a plum. What a fruit. Thanks for the rock, Pnak, I really wanted one."
<p>
   Unfortunately, he hasn't quite got the best view for this spell, I think. And I'm not wasting time on a spell that'll go
   unnapreciated. Instead, I'll go over and physically check to see if the windows are locked or not, as only a Hobbit can't.

401 - hobbit_king - 3/26/00 8:48 pm
<p>
   With Kopfy at my side and Lilac on my shoulder we cross the street and enter the ruined building. As any good leader
   would, I use my natural inborn Hobbitiod stealth to sneak most expertly. Sneaking as only a Hobbit can. Moving in and to
   the right we find a hiding spot behind a large stack of crates.
<p>
   I wonder how long will take for us to discover these Goblins I think to myself. Looking around I can't help but imagine
   what that bumbling triple M is doing. I scratch my head and look around a bit more. 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">

402 - Kopfy - 3/27/00 3:07 pm
<p>
   Shipy wonders how long will take for us to discover these Goblins he thinks to myself. Looking around, he can't help but
   imagine what that bumbling triple M is doing. He lays his head on a not-too-moldy burlap sack to rest his neck while he
   keeps watchin the scene. 
<p>
   Meanwhile both Pnahk and Micheal seeing something out of the corners of their eyes. The light from the lamp post
   flickers then blackens. As soft growls is heard from back across the street.
<p>
   The ever disciplined Taran and Jax notice the blackness while they sit back to back. They also hear the growling. Mists
   begin to creep up from the heavy iron sewer grates and from the south. The moisture is filled with the scents of wastes
   and swampiness.
  <p>
Jax spies fleeting tall, too-slender shadows moving to from where the lampost is to the alleys between the warehouses
   and rundown buildings.
<p>
(Taran failed a 3rd level SR on Lk. And is too busy
wondering where the light went and thinking how much
it stinks in this neighborhood.)

   Jax looks at his script and realizes he's in the
   wrong place. "D'oh!"

   He makes a L1SR to remember the direction for
   stage left, and clamors up the rooftop to join
   his ever-yappin' bro.

   "Hey dude, what took you so long?" Taran yaps as
   Jax manuevers into the specified back-to-back
   stance.

   "Shadows? No, where?" Taran lifts his crossbow cranked with a whammied bolt and scans the ground level with his
   brown eyes.
<p>
   "By the lamp post, T," Jax points out with an outstretched arm.
<p>
   As they scan their misty, stinky--"Is that you, Jax? No, wasn't me! I thought it was you!"--surroudings, Taran muses....
   "By the way, Bro, the reason I was gonna stay top side is because I've got ranged striking distance, while you was gonna
   stay below side is because you've got up close, personal and decapitating distance. But it's nice of you to join me on the
   roof nontheless so we can watch each other's backs. I guess that's what script rewrites are for."
<p>
   "P.S. How come I'm always failing my L1SR on Luck? I even took that as my 2nd level attribute advancement! Frak!"

   Anybody else? what do you do?

   <p>
   "Hey bro," Jax spoke with a hushed voice.
   <p>
   "Yeah."
   <p>
   "When's the last time you had some of Hannibal's sausages?"
   <p>
   Taran paused, confused. "Urm, last week, why?"
   <p>
   "When you ate 'em, did you have that tingly, sparkly
   sensation in your mouth, kinda like when you chew that
   Flavor Crystals(TM) gum?"
   <p>
   Taran shook his head, a not unuseful gesture in the dark
   due to the orcish night vision, except his back was to his
   brother who didn't see the motion. "Oh, uh, no. They went
   down smooth and greasy as ever."
   <p>
   "I thought so," Jax considered.
   <p>
   Taran added, "Gave me gas, too."
   <p>
   "Right, well Hannibal wouldn't have it any other way.
   Anyway, either Hannibal has a new sparkling version of his
   sausages, being chewed upon as we speak, or...." Jax
   indicated westward in the direction of the shop, making
   sure Taran followed his line of sight.
   <p>
   "....or there's goblins in the mists!" Taran confirmed,
   as they both spied the gathering of humanoids outside the
   shop with their hotvision(TM).
   <p>
   Jax looked at his brother, and they both could feel the rush of
   adrenaline that accompanied the discovery. "Stay
   topside and try not to get trigger happy," Jax took charge.
   "I'm gonna descend--so watch my back--and get a
   better position on these grunts."
   <p>
   [[ Sound good, jaxdracon? Once Jax descends,
   Taran'll decide whether or not he wants to play SniperOrc true to
   his name, or climb down after. ]]

   Jax begins his climb down the roof by the rain gutter.
   The coolness of the of the tin pipe tingles his uncannily
   tactile ork hands (oops orc). His keen ork ears here the smaller
   footsteps of at least two goblins below him
   coming around the corner and standing below him next to the
   water barrell where the pipe ends.
   <p>
   Do you try to stay in place w/o being detected (3 SR LK)<br>
   or,<br>
   drop down onto the the goblins (1 SR DX loudly, 4 SR DX quietly)

   Michael of the Midnight Magicks hears some garbage russle from the alley
   to his left.

   From his crouched perch on the roof of the warehouse,
   Taran, watching his brother's descent and the ground
   below with interest, spies the goblins. He silently
   trains his crossbow on the lead one. "Whatcha gonna do,
   bro?" he thinks to himself.
   <p>
   [[ Taran will yield initiative to Jax, figuring
   whatever he or they both do, Jax'll be in the thick of it and should be
   the one to decide how to proceed. ]]

   "Where are all the goblins Kopfy?" I ask, a bit louder than is needed.
   <p>
   "Where'd the sprite go off too?"
   <p>
   "Gezz Kopfy... this is boring as hell. All I've seen
   is two pigeons mating and one rat. When are we going to see some action?"

   Obviously some bum, such as Shippo, rooting around for dinner.
   I try to avoid eye contact, so they don't ask me for money.
