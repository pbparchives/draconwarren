265 - Kopfy - 3/8/00 11:12 pm
<p>
   Into the tavern walks a heavy-set warrior(?) with a brass breast plate and the red cape of the Khazan Fire Watch. His
   square, jowled face looks across the room as if looking for somebody. Finding the poor, downtroden (yet charmingly
   handsome) ork-sage (and the best character of this whole group), the watchman puffs his already massive frame into a
   posture of confidence and authority. He strides with a purpose towards our hapless hero. Kopfy looks at first into his swill
   then back up meeting the official's gaze directly though subdued for his fierce orkish manner.
<p>
   "They told me I could find you here orc." Cpt. Huros spits. "I have come to collect my inspection fee for that tinderbox
   you call a home."
<p>
   "Buy you a drink?" Kopfy asks meekly but seeing no changed in the fat man's expression answers directly. "I don't have
   enough silvers for your bribe you despicable sword rattler. But I have a plan to help you out with the goblins that have
   been keeping your boys busy on the full moons."
<p>
   Huros squints, almost angered but has been serving in the gray areas of Khazan too many years to put haughtiness before
   a helpful offer. 
<p>
   "And what do you know about these troubles, orc scum?" He asks.
<p>
   "Well I know they aren't climbing over your precious citywalls from the swamp." Kopfy states draining his goblet. "I think
   you know that too."
<p>
   "What are you saying?" Huros pulls himself visbly back.
<p>
   "That you don't want to send your watch lackeys into the sewers under the lower market district where the gobblins are
   coming from." Kopfy says. "Instead you send out patrols into the swamps to make it look like your doing something about
   it."
<p>
   Before the captain can pull his long sword from its blue and red scabbard, the ork sage calmly turns his back and orders
   another drink. The river ork barmaid brings him two goblets.
<p>
   (Not for you Shipy)
<p>
   "But why should you endanger your well-trained and most experienced men," Kopfy continues, "when a drunken wretch
   like me can find a few capable and willing adventurers to scout out the warren for you?"
<p>
   The ork turns and offers the second goblet to the watchman.
<p>
   Huros laughs with his head thrown back. He takes his hand from the hilt of his sword and accepts the cup.
<p>
   "Oh you are rich." He takes a drink, letting a bit slip down the side of his fat face. "But you are right. I could use a
   diversionary tactic on the small band in the sewers, while I concentrated my regular force on the greater threat posed to
   us from the swamp. But I assume this doesn't come free, and probably not just for my measely fee."
<p>
   Kopfy scratches his stubble-covered green chin thoughtfuly for a second. "Let's say 60 gold to start for the party to
   assemble, 400 each after they bring back proof of their endeavors and no tax on any treasure they acquire."
<p>
   "No tax?" Horus ask blank faced.
<p>
   "Well, three percent for Fire and Safety Horde along with inspection exemption of all members for a year." Kopfy says.
<p>
   "Ok sounds fair." Horus agrees and takes another swig.
<p>
   The fat captain sits down on the barstool next to Kopfy, as Pnahk has gone to the lil ghoul's room. He slips in robe and
   breastplate onto the stoll beside him. 
<p>
   "Ah a good days work done. I can report some new pomise to my warlord tomorrow." Huros says. "SO Kopfhatt, who all
   did you have in mind?"
<p>
   "Ah let me introduce Mikey the Mighty Murky..."
<p>
   Kopf indicates Michael. 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
269 - jimship12 - 3/9/00 8:37 am
<p>
   Listening to Kopfy and Cpt. Huros speak I just sit saying nothing, twiddling my thumbs, somewhat huffed. It seems very
   odd that Kopfy forgot to introduce me, being that I am the party leader and all.
<p>
   The river ork barmaid brings two goblets and I hold my hand out to accept one. "Not for you Shipy," snaps Kopfy before
   I can take a hold of it. I flex my fingers acting as though I was just stretching, a scowl setting on my face.
<p>
   Watching closely Kopfy eventually sets his drink on the bar, busy with his conversation. Taking his drink I pour half of it
   into mine and quickly return it, smiling. I notice Titania (our beautiful sprite) does not miss my action, but then again she
   doesn’t miss anything.
<p>
   May day only gets worse as Kopfy says, "Ah let me introduce Mikey the Mighty Murky..." He seems to yet again
   overlook the party leader I think to myself.

<p>
   "What? Oh, yes, that would be me, more or less. Ah, good captain, besides the 60gp assemblage fee- I'll need one other
   thing- a saw, large enough to saw a person in a box in half. Or a goblin, as the case may be."
<p>
   "And please, let me introduce my apprentice, Shippo the burrower and my lovely assistant, Blossom the pixie."
<p>
   "That's them there."
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
272 - misfitsprite - 3/9/00 11:24 am
<p>
   I was watching Shipo with a small sly grin on my face (trying hard not to laugh) when Michael's statement took me by
   surprise. I regard him for a split second then turned to the Captain and gave him my sweetest girlie smile (which does
   include batting eyelashes).
<p>
   "Greetings kind sire," I tell him repestfully "Would you care to see a show. Michael here is a wonder at illusion. Pleae say
   you stay and watch. It would be a GREAT honor to say that you graced us with your presence." (batting eyelashes again
   included)
<P>

<p>
   Actually, had Jax the Orc been conscious to hear
   Michael refer to Lilac as "Titania," he would have
   enjoyed the allusion to the Fairie Queen from
   Shakespeare's "A Midsummer's Night Dream."
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
275 - jimship12 - 3/9/00 2:21 pm
   Noticing Lilac batting her eyelashes I say, "You got something in your eye
Lilac? Because if you do I'd be happy to help you get it out!"
Wondering to myself if she’s went and got some fairy dust in her eyes.

278 - misfitsprite - 3/9/00 4:55 pm
<p>
   Still smiling at the captain I swiftly kick Shipy under the bar. A lock of hair fell over my shoulder and I toss it back
   causually.
<p>
   'Pick a card good sire?' I ask the captain 'You will like this trick, I promise.' smiles sweetly (not batting her eyelashes).
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
280 - jimship12 - 3/9/00 7:05 pm
<p>
   Still considering Lilac’s batting eye lash problem she delivers a sudden blow in one of my more sensitive area’s and I
   tumble under the bar like a discarded fruit. Lying face down beneath the bar my sensitive area suggest I should remain
   there for a moment longer. Who would have thought she was a violent sprite. Lilac certainly doesn’t sound like a violent
   name, Dandelion maybe, but not Lilac. Looking around under the bar I find a tin coin and smile widely. Maybe it was
   worth the pain after all I think to myself, grasping the tin coin with my chubby Hobbit fingers......
<p>
   Who can understand women? They talk to you one time and karate chop you the next, I think to myself. 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
288 - Kopfy - 3/10/00 2:38 am
<p>
   Huros looks at the assemble party in front of him. A violent pixie; a fairly unremarkable stage wizard; a hobbit w/o
   enough sense to wear a guard in the right areas; and a bar-stool philosopher, an ork (no less). The captain looks at Kopfy
   and smiles,
   "I'll get you the 60 in the morning." He says. "The full moon is tomorrow night, will you be ready?"
<p>
   'ready as I'll ever be.' thinks the ork but he says, "Of course, we have been working together for sometime."
<p>
   Huros turns to look at Michael of the Midnight Magic.
<p>
   "Do I look like I sell hardware, guppy?" 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
292 - eickeric - 3/10/00 8:58 am

   Of course not! I don't want you to SELL me a saw, I want you to PROCURE it for me! Don't worry, I'm sure you can
   handle the job. Brave heart, Tegan.

<p>
   Taran, witnessing the recruiting session a few seats down at the bar, pokes his brother in the arm. "Wake up, mug face!
<p>
   Staying up half the night on watch isn't going to get you out of this adventure!"
<p>
   "Hurumpgh? Ughnn-nuhgnn." Jax shakes his mug face from side to side repeatedly. "Uh-ee-uh-ee-uh-ee-uh-ee. Ok, I'm
   awake. What's going on over there?" He rubs his eyes.
<p>
   Taran summarizes: "Goblins in the mist, big fat guy wants some help investigating. And he's paying. I'm thinking of
   crashing the party. Whattaya think, bro?"
<p>
Taran muses to his brother, "Of course, one cannot truly appreciate
Shakespeare until it is heard in its original orcish."
<p>

311 - Kopfy - 3/11/00 12:11 am
<p>
   Huros's brow wrinkles in conserntation, then pull aprt suddenly.
<p>
   "Okay I have a halbeard that might do the trick." He says with a smile. "Swing by Watchpost Druxel and tell them Big
   'Un said hook you up.'"

   "Whether it is noble to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune? Or to sleep, per chance to dream?" says the
   note on the bar napkin sent by Kopfy to the brothers, in Yithan (an orc trading language.)

323 - jimship12 - 3/11/00 10:18 am

   Crawling out from under the bar I hit my head, causing a loud thump, and the bar to rattle. Taking my drink with me I
   move down the bar away from the violent sprite. Note to self, 'Keep out of sprite's reach Shipy!' I rub the new lump on
   my head and sip from my filled mug (re-filled from Kopfy's mug), eyeing the sprite. 
<P>

326 - Kopfy - 3/11/00 7:33 pm

Kopfy goes to sip his swill and realizes
in all the excitement he drank it all in one swig.

"Uh Captian," He asks meekly, "Could I get 20 on that 60 tonight?"

   To the hobbit...Pssst- Shipshape, is there a good pawn shop in town?* 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
337 - hobbit_king - 3/12/00 4:30 pm
<p>
   Looking around I hear the sound... "Pssst" emanating from Mikey the Mighty Murky. At first I think he as sprung a leak,
   but then I understand he is attempting to gain my attention. 
<p>
   Looking at me with his usual stupid expression Mikey the Mighty Murky says, "Shipshape, is there a good pawn shop in
   town?"
<p>
   Pausing for a moment I say, "Yes!"
<p>
   "Where?" he asks, viewing me sternly.
<p>
   "Two blocks south of here, next to the alley, on the left. ‘Demeral’s Pawns and More.’ I’ve been there many times. If
   you would, don’t mention my name though. I believe I still owe Demeral some money. He does have an guard Ogre
   named Brunt who works for him who has promised to smash me like an over-rip grape if he ever finds me." I try to force
   a smile, making it appear as to not worry me. 
<P>

<P>
338 - Kopfy - 3/12/00 7:11 pm
<p>
   Kopfy sits back and realizes its a bit late. 
<P>
   "Well all." He states "It is late. And I want to be well rested before our sojourn. Meet me tomorrow night before the
   eleventh bell at the lamplight on Guhler's Footpath and Wild Horse Roadway."
<P>
   Staggering a bit more than he wants to, the ork hits the doorframe with his shoulder as he exits.
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
339 - Kopfy - 3/12/00 9:43 pm
<p>
   Captain Huros begins putting on his breast plate and looks at the hobbit and Michael of the Midnight Magic. He focuses in
   on Shipy. He speaks in whispered tones below the clammer of the tavern.
<p>
   "You must be the ork's connection to the thieves guild." He states with a slight slur. "I hear you are the master assassin
   but don't think that I go down easily. Just remember to tell your bosses that I went ahead and didn't have the flee-ridden
   tinder-box torn to the ground, so we're even. And don't let this party of yours get out of line."
<p>
   With that he begins to pull on his red cape and adjust himself into an officious pose. He takes his still half full drink, that no
   one bothered, and toast the human, hobbit, and fairy.
<p>
   "Here's to success in our joint efforts to rid this fair city of the monthly goblin attacks." He gulps down the last of his swill,
   then turns to the rest of the humanoids at the bar. "And remember only you can inform on an arsonist before he burns
   down your house. And don't drop matches in the forest because only you can prevent forest fires."
<p>
   "Now if you all will excuse me, I have to go see to the placing of some heads on pikes at the South Gate." He says as he
   turns to leave. 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
341 - hobbit_king - 3/12/00 10:53 pm
<p>
   Ending my humorous act, my mood suddenly turns serious, as does my expression. "I admit to nothing," I whisper, "but
   remember this, that ork you speak of so casually has very important friends. Friends who would do ‘ANYTHING’ he
   asked." I touch Captain Huros breast plate with my finger as if were a dirk. "I see you understand that. Our party will
   stay within the boundaries of the law."
<p>
   I notice Kopfy staggering a bit more than he wants to, the ork hits the doorframe with his shoulder as he exits. Waiting a
   moment I follow him at a discreet distance, using the shadows as my cover. Also wondering if Kopfy ever wonders why
   he never gets mugged in the lowliest section of Khazan.
<p>
   Seeing Kopfy home I continue on. The next night I stand in the shadows leaning against the Ice House across the street
   from the lamp near Guhler's Footpath and Wild Horse Roadway. Few probably knew the cold emanating from the Ice
   House wall's cloaked my heat signature from those who could truly see in the dark. I continued to wait for the others
   leaning against the cold stone wall.

342 - Kopfy - 3/13/00 8:03 am
<p>
At the Watchpost Druxel, our interpid hero,
Mikey, finds a tall scarred elf with dark brown hair,
sitting on a stool, reading the daily rag.
He is drinking strong coffee with his feet
propped up on the small table at the center of the stable-like
building. Seeing the youth at the doorway
he reluctantly swings his boots back onto the floor and folds up the news
parchment.
<p>
"Kann' ich, ihnen helfen Junge?" The elf
asks in Black Wood Forest Trade tongue of gnomes,
dwarves,porkers, and elves.
<p>
...there Michael of the Midnight Magics
gets to speak German and gets his armor and
weapons. The veteran warrior shows the
Stage Magician how to wear his armor and
get two times the protection a non-warrior type would.

   <em>"Shipshape, is there a good pawnshop in town?"</em>
<p>
   It takes him a while to understand the question because there is a long pause before he finally answers "Yes!"
<p>
   My curiousity satisfied, I turn from him, but he continues to ramble on, mimicking different voices "Where?" and a whole
   babble of words I'm completely disinterested in, and ignoring completely. Perhaps he was hit too hard by the fairy?
<p>
   Sigh, you can't get good help these days. Perhaps that's why I keep involuntarily staring at him in such a superior manner.
<P>

345 - eickeric - 3/13/00 11:54 am
<p>
   Youth? I've aged well.
<p>
   "Thanks for the gear, I'm sure Big 'Un'll be happy with all the friendly service- do you have a customer survey card I
   could fill out? Thanks for the armor lessons too, to say nothing of the language... Next time I'm studying for Balrog. They
   aren't much for communication- but it's a great language for swearing in." 
<p>
   (Although some of it seemed slightly repetitive- I suppose I must have learned something to attain the experience I have,
   unless lousy Stage Magician is a more rewarding endeavor than I suspected).
<p>
   Presumably, he gives me the armor and two dirks. Forget the halberd, I haven't got nearly the strength for it anyway.
<p>
   If so, I'll head on my way to the lamppost to meet with the others. As I turn to leave, I'll look at the elf conspiratorily and
   say "Remember, only forest fires prevent bears."
<p>
   Off to the lamppost.

<p>
   Taran finished his mug slowly as he watched the red cape-billowing solicitor of kindreds-for-hire, and his exchange with
   the orc, fairy, hobbit, and, curiously enough, familiar-looking mummy. After they all leave, he speaks softly such that only
   his brother can hear him.
<p>
   "Brother, I say we sign up for this job. I've heard enough to know that the pay will be good, and we have yet to really get
   a good stash of gold under our hay-pallet. Wouldn't it be nice to establish a new Dracon warren in this new dimension?
   Arahk only knows when or if we'll ever get back to Khazan again."
<p>
   Jax ponders, thoughtfully. His enhanced intelligence sizes up the situation. "Why don't we introduce ourselves, our
   services, and a smattering of our credentials," he begins, pointing to the handle of his vorpal blade. "Tell them that Pnakh
   used to be our colleague. Of course, that is not entirely true, since our association as Agents of Arahk Gnahk did not offer
   us the chance to meet the mummy. We know what happened to the Pnakh from our dimension from the reports, and if
   this incarnation of Pnakh is as honorable as his counterpart from our world, it would be an honor to serve at his side."
<p>
   "Alrighty, bro. Finish your drink. We should go talk to that noisy orc fellow. He seems to think he is in charge."
<p>
   And with that, the brothers Dracon rose, and headed out the door.

   Long after the others have left, I sit and ponder what has occured this nite.Sighing to myself, I fly out the tavern door to
   find what sleep I can before the meeting time. I toss and turn and finally deceide to give up hope on a few shut eyes.

   Gathering my gear, I fly to the roof top of a house where I can cleary see the street below and wait for the others to
   arrive.

   Ok, here's a re-presentation of Taran Dracon,
   now that we've established that he's post M!M! adventure.
   <pre>
   Taran "SniperOrc" Dracon (orc/warrior)
   --------------------------------------
   Strength: 18
   Constitution: 16
   Luck: 11
   Dexterity: 11
   Intelligence: 9
   Charisma: -15
   Combat Adds: +6 

   Size: 13
   Speed: 17
   Level: 2
   Points: 1153

   (Note, the level and points are current as of right before
   Taran's demise. After his resurrection, I assume that he will
   have gained more points. But I'm not really worried about this now.)

   Equipment:
   * crossbow + cranequin (5d6 damage)
   * enchanted quiver of 20 enchanted bolts
   -----
   Note on the quiver and bolts: Here is an excerpt from
   Taran's early adventures as an Agent of Arahk Gnahk. In this
   scene, Arahk Gnahk the great "orc" shaman has led Taran to his
   armory to get suited up for his first mission...

   "O Great One," [Taran] said, "as you see, I
   am a bowman, but it is often hard to get missiles for my weapon.
   Could you perhaps do something to help me with that?" 

   "Gladly, Lad," smiled the shaman. He took the quiver, stared
   at it intensely and red beams shot from his eyes to leave the
   quiver glowing with a red light, and each of the twenty
   bolts within it glowed as well. "I have enchanted the quiver
   and the bolts within it. As long as you take the bolts
   out of the quiver yourself, it will never be empty. If you
   let another take the last bolt, the enchantment will be broken.
   Oh, and I have placed a "seek" enchantment on the
   missiles--within range, they will almost never miss." 

   "What do you mean--almost never miss?" asked Taran. 

   "Well, nothing is 100 percent in this world," quipped Arahk
   Gnahk. "Even my sorcery may fail if it meets greater
   wizardry." [On any shot Taran makes, he must roll at least a
   5 on a Dexterity saving roll in order to hit. That's a
   Zero Level saving roll and is worth no adventure points.]

   And now we continue with your regularly scheduled inventory.
   ---
   * Uncle Dracon's bastard sword
   * eating knife
   * leather tunic/pants
   * backpack containing:
   -- * engraved hand axe

   ----
   Note on the axe: see
   http://www.geocities.com/~trollgod/taran_text1.html#4 for details.
   ----

   -- * crummy wizard's robe
   -- * 1 serpent power totem (50 uses, up to 20 STR pts per
        use for spellcasting)
   -- * pouch of cantrips
   -- * money pouch containing 4 silver serpents (coins)
        and some coins of this new land
   -- * magic staff (2d6 damage)

   For those keeping up with the adventure, I assume the
   following: 1) The sealed message to Captain Stonenose Glump
   which Taran was supposed to deliver was cracked open and
   burnt in the firery crash with the balrog. 2) Taran got his
   orc head back in addition to his life. 3) Taran and Jax
   were transported to this land/dimension and took up some kind of
   guard job to get a bit of fundage.

   So, Mr. GM, any questions?
