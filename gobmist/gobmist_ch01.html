You know, if I wasn’t such a big hunk of horse dung my dear friend Pnakh....
that and I had any real coins. I would of course buy you a round of dark swill.
<p>
(Taking the free drink I gulp it like desert nomad. Waving the infectious
cloud of dust away from my drink.)
<p>
Where is everyone? Even my friend Kopfy, or that unusual fellow Kaimaret
seems to have wandered off. Come to think of it so has the ork serving wenches!
Can you even speak Pnakh?
<p>
(I eye Pnakh closely, but he doesn’t even seem to move. Then again my vision
is a bit blurry.)
<p>
I swallow the last of my drink and the fragments within it in one last gulp.
<p>
(I consider trying Pnakh for a second free drink, but I pass out before
making a decision.)

<p>
   Schatzi...could you run a tab for the next round and my esteemed colleages
here...
<p>
   (Aside to the boys)
<p>
   She's been sweet on me since I got beat up by that barbarian bouncing
from the Northern Waste. She likes a bleeder...

133 - jimship12 - 2/23/00 10:08 am

   Is that you Kopfy? (Shaking the fairies from my head. Just waking up from
being passed out on the bar.) Where’d Pnakh go, he was just sitting there
gathering dust a moment ago, I think... what day is it? (Kopfy eyes me
suspiciously.)
<p>
   So the ork bar maid is sweet on you Kopfy? If the truth be known she’s
sweet on everyone if’n get my meaning. Being a good bleeder doesn’t hurt
though. (I smile slightly, thinking about her ork charms.*)
<p>
   Tell me your troubles? The bar sage is to help.... you know, if’n you buy
me a drink and all.

137 - Kopfy - 2/23/00 11:50 pm
<p>
   Well I didn't say I wanted to marry her, my furry-footed friend.
<p>
   Pnakh stepped out to the boy's room, I believe.
<p>
   Now all I have to do is get a golden into the pocket of Fire Watch captain
Huros and I wont have move my fine assortment of grimores and scrolls to yet
another rathole.

138 - jimship12 - 2/24/00 12:16 am
<p>
   Have you ever considered letting someone solve your watch captain problem
for you Kopfy? (I make a quick gesture across my throat and then scan the
tavern for Pnakh.)
<p>
   Less a few coin and he might’n be a floater. (I study Kopfy’s knavish face,
wondering if he up to it.) Its not likely his pimply ass will be missed.
(I free a lump of dirt from between my Hobbit toes with my dirk....
waiting for his answer.)

<P>
140 - tarandracon - 2/24/00 10:40 am
<p>
   Suddenly the doors to the tavern burst open. Two orcs walk through,
obviously enjoying their conversation.
<p>
   "Well, I kicked that joker bassaf out," one of the two orcs speaks.
"Told him if he ever wanted to see his dog again, he'd head for the hills
to a hu-man bar. This here ain't no place for pansy hu-mans. Now warrior
humans, maybe...."
<p>
   "Agreed, Taran," the second orc replies. "Even if you are the younger
stripling, you got spunk."
<p>
   "Let's step up to the bar, Jax," the orc named Taran grumbles. But then,
he spots the shambling mound of cloth strips somehow (magically?) held
together, at the front and center of the bar. "Uh, maybe let's get a table
instead." 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
141 - jimship12 - 2/24/00 11:14 am
<p>
   Spinning on my bar stood I watch the two new arrivals closely.
(Thinking, that’s just what we need... two more orcs to liven’ up the joint!*)
I flex my large hobbit toes. Climbing off the bar stool I approach the two orcs.
<p>
   "Hi.... Apple... and Jax. I may have a job for you two. Are you interested?"
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
144 - pnakh - 2/24/00 2:50 pm
<p>
   (Pnakh orders another flagon of embalming solution enriched mead and
wonders whether the orcs will eat the Hobbit's toe hairs, or spit them out.) 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
154 - jimship12 - 2/25/00 8:47 am
<p>
Having quickly decided the two orcs I referred to earlier as Apple and Jax
were not exactly my type of drinking companions, I quickly took my small
nimble Hobbit frame back over to the safety of the bar, climbing up on an open
bar stool between Kopfy and Pnakh. 
<p>
"So... guys... old friends, didn’t I buy the last round of drinks?"
I ask them brazenly, looking from one to the other. 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
155 - Kopfy - 2/26/00 12:19 am
<p>
Kopfy looks hopefully at Pnahk, wondering just how far the barmaid will let my
tab go this moon-cycle.
<p>  
I scratch my left bat-like ear, the one with the bite mark in the lobe,
and casually roll my slender neck across both of knobby shoulders--as to get
a better look around the bar and the two newcomers. With an absent-minded air
I flex the hand with 4 out of five claws still on it and run them through my
sandy-blonde hair, which is contrast my green skin. I relax to let my mountain
ork frame pull itself up from the crouching huddling around a mug causes and
smile with my lipless, gnarly fanged smile.
<p>
"Nah Horus for being the fat, bribable city clerk that he is would probably
survive any attack on him." I say swigging only half of my dark ale.
"I've heard stories...maybe we can get him to find us a job delving some sewer
that's been overrun by goblins?" 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
156 - jimship12 - 2/26/00 1:45 am
<p>
   Still seated on the bar stool between Kopfy and Pnakh I look from one
to the other, sipping my newly purchased drink of dark swill. (I wonder to
myself if Pnakh will ever discover I added it to his bar tab. I smile inwardly
as only Hobbits can.) 
<p>
"Tell me more about these goblins Kopfy?"
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
159 - misfitsprite - 2/29/00 3:42 pm
<p>
   A silver light comes through the dirty tavern window and gently floats
to the bar... it softly lands on the edge of the bar and a small figure
appears. A pixie with silver hair is there wearing a silver tunic and holds
a small silver inlaid ivory staff in her hands. She gazes up at you and your
compains and speaks, "I hear you guys are having some fun around here and was
wondering if you could use some help?" 
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
160 - jimship12 - 2/29/00 4:59 pm
<p>
   Sitting in my normally slouched position on the bar stool between Kopfy
and Pnakh (I first cast a glance from one to the other just in case I’m
dreaming... or still in a drunken stupor.) As usual Pnakh never moves but I
do notice Kopfy eyeing the newly arrived pixie.
<p>
   "So you're a pixie huh?" I stretch my short hobbit legs scrutinizing her
closely as all hobbits do. (Wondering what her ivory staff would be worth
at the Khazan Magic-Mart.) "We don’t get very many pixie visitors in here
you know. Mostly stinky orks... sorry Kopfy, I wasn’t talking about you."
He nods understandingly.  "There was one the other day... no, I take that back
it was a sprite, or was it brownie... anywho, I’m glad to meet you.
Most just call me Hobb.  Kopfy and I are open to for a we bit of adventure...
yee most comely pixie?" 
<p>
   "Care to buy I friendly Hobb a drink?"
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
161 - misfitsprite - 2/29/00 6:21 pm
<p>
   "Greetings Hobb, Kopfy, and Pnakh... my fiends just call me sprite... and
buy a u a drink u ask? hmmm...." 
<p>
   I reach into my belt pouch and toss a steel mark on the counter.. "Barkeep,
a round of drinks for my compains here. As for myself i carry my own." A
silver flask appears in my hands and i take a healthy swig.  I turn my
attention back at the three sitting before me, "So boys, whats the name of the
game we're after?"
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
162 - jimship12 - 2/29/00 7:13 pm
<p>
   Since no one else seems willing to be the first to speak to the charming
pixie I take command of the situation. The barkeep grumbles something as he
serves our newly purchased drinks. I smile to the pixie when they are
delivered. 
<p>
   "Thanks kindly for the dark swill... M’lady," I acknowledge, rubbing the
foam away from my Hobbit lips with my shirt sleeve after taking a drink. "A
pixie named Sprite... very interesting! My ork-sage friend here beside me
(i.e. Kopfy) has discovered news that a goblin clan has infested the sewers
in lower dock-side. He’n figures the Watch Captain would reward us handsomely
if’n we routed them miscreants post haste. It’d be a three way split of all
loot garnered, four if Pnakh joins us. Am I to assume you’re in then Sprite?"
<p>
   "We leave as soon as I finish me’ swill!"
<P>
<img src="images/hr_tnt.gif">
<P>
163 - Kopfy - 3/1/00 1:24 am
<p>
Kopfy sighs in relief as the next round of Pigs' ale arrives.
I take a long swig of the fresh, cool dark swill and lick my lipless yapper
with a loud sigh.
<p>
   "Well met and all sturf Pixel gal." I say "Now Hobbs here and our esteemed
piece of moldy adventurer, here..." (indicating Pnahk) "...where just
discussing on how we might get some delving done and saving the apartment of a
very humble schollar." 
<P>

165 - pnakh - 3/1/00 6:33 am

   (Pnakh grumbles flakily into his mead *)
<p>
   "Have to get my boots - sewer muck messes up my dressings"
<p>
   "I'll meet you at the dockside, you can't miss me, I'll be the only guy hanging around in bandages and gum boots waving a
   mitre."

   <p>
   Well, for what it is worth, in case the current bar chatting
   turns into an adventure, here are the stats on Taran Dracon,
   prior to his adventure (and demise) in Khazan as an Agent of
   Arahk Gnahk (c.f.  http://www.geocities.com/~trollgod/frames.html).
   Which means he is very green behind the ears, and still alive (ha ha). Of
   course, this could be an alternate-dimension Taran. I guess it depends
   on if you want to play in KStA's Khazan or someone else's.
   <P>
   <pre>
   Taran "SniperOrc" Dracon (orc/warrior)
   --------------------------------------
   Strength: 18
   Constitution: 16

   * leather tunic/pants
   </pre>
   P.S. If this is the same Taran we all know and love so well
   (assuming he comes back to the living after KStA's
   adventure, then his stats and equipment are slightly different.
   See his current stats for details
   (http://www.geocities.com/~trollgod/taran_stats.html).

178 - jaxdracon - 3/2/00 12:26 pm
<p>
   Jax too is in a quandry. (* Scratches knobby head
   with his meaty claw. Haven't I seen this putrid
   rag heap before? Or have I? *)
   <p>
   If indeed this Jax exists before KStA's "Agents of
   Lerotra'hh" adventure, then he will not have 10
   extra points of intelligence nor a vorpal scimitar
   at his disposal.
   <p>
   OTOH, if Jax, and presumably Taran and Pnakh, have
   already been through that monstrous adventure,
   then I'll have to rewrite the ending so that we
   all survive (heh-heh).
   <p>
   Of course, if the former option is in force, then
   Jax would not have thought of all this, because
   he'd be as dumb as a, well, Orc. (* Brain does a
   core dump due to the existential stress. Slumps
   in barstool and vigorously smacks the bar with
   head. *)
   <p>
   Taran leans over, yanks up Jax's listless head
   by the eye sockets and examines his brother
   casually. "Hey, barkeep, better make his a
   double!"

   There is a rattle at the door. Apparantly someone is pushing, where it
clearly says `pull'.
<p>
   Eventually, the door opens and in strides a man dressed in black robes.
Frankly, he looks unimpressive. Not too strong, nor particularly handsome,
but he does radiate power.
<p>
   Until he trips on his robe.
<p>
   "mutter, mumble, stupid regulation costume, yadda yadda yadda..."
<p>
   (looks around)
<p>
   'Ah! behold! I am Michael of the Midnight Magics. Tremble at my might!"
<p>
   He pulls a 10' series of knotted handkerchiefs out of his sleeve.

   "Do not fear, I shall not harm you unless provoked. Has anyone got a
sundial for my next trick?"

   I'm taking a swig out of my silver flask when I hear a commotion at the
door and nearly choke. Slightly flapping my wings, I raise myself from my
seated postion on the bar table and watch the new arrival with interest.
<p>
   I hear his proclamation and nearly double over with laughter. 'What a
curious looking creature' I think to myself. 'Wonder where he was dragged up
from.'
<p>
   I take another swig and then put my flask back into my pouch.

   Kopfy looks over at the human and then at the fairy gal. He nudges Shipo
who seems a bit on the downside of consciousness to respond. With a sigh he
awaits for the introductions to bge complete.
<p>
   "If he pulls a rabbit out of his hat," He thinks with lopsided, fangy smile,
"we've got dinner."

250 - jimship12 - 3/8/00 8:52 am
<p>
Suddenly awaken by his antics or Kopfy nudging me, I look at our new arrival.
Shaking my head I say, "Silly mage...  twix’s are for kids!"
Motioning him a bit closer to the bar I introduce this ‘Michael of the
Midnight Magics’ guy to everyone else, (the well wrapped) Pnakh,
(the orkish-sage) Kopfy, the beautiful little (wizardess) sprite, and
myself... (a roguish) Hobb (my real name being ‘Shipy The Cunning’),
but for some odd reason Kopfy has taken to calling me Shipo.
I ignore it mostly.
<p>
   "If he pulls a rabbit out of his hat...we've got dinner," says Kopfy smiling a lopsided, fangy smile. 
<p>
   "Forget the damn sundial Michael of the Midnight Magics, we have more
important things to worry about. Don’t you know.... there are Goblins in the
Mists?"
<P>

253 - eickeric - 3/8/00 10:51 am
<p>
   Michael peers at the sprite. "Sorry Titania, I broke THAT sundial learning
the trick inthe first place. Ah well, it was an hour off anyway." 
<p>
   "Thanks for the intro, squirt. I'm pretty lousy at names,
so remind me a few times, okay? No offense intended if I forget a
   few dozen times. Nametags are often helpful. I'm sure you've all heard of
me, Michael of the Midnight Magics, but my
   friends call me... well, they only call me that when they're mad.
Never mind."
<p>
   "Oh, I do have a rabbit, Koffee. (Am I saying that correctly? Orcish never
WAS my best language...) I doubt you'd want
   to eat it though. It's stuffed. I call it a `beanie buddy'. Just wait,

   "Nope! Never heard of you! I bet they do! Okay, Titania, Kopfy, Pnakh,

<p>
   "Tell him Kopfy! Kopfy?" I say, nudging the ork-sage who wasn’t paying
attention.
