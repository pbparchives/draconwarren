   Khara_Khang...(continues)
   <p>
   [[GM]] With Lilac sitting on Vortex’s head, the friendly rhino
   does what ever she asks it to do. Heading back down the sewer passage
   Lilac turns Vortex down the new secret corridor (which is not a sewer
   passage). Taran and the hobbit Shipy following behind the large
   rhino which fills most of the corridor. Having little to fear from traps
   (due to the rhino’s size and weigh), the warrior orc and short-legged
   hobbit almost have to run to keep up. The corridor continues for a long
   ways, and then turns and continues just as far again (with each turn
   over 300 feet and sloping downward). Eventually the corridor ends in a
   wooden door.
   <p>
   Either not knowing how to apply the brakes or having no intention to,
   the huge pachyderm plows through the door at a full trot. The wooden
   door explodes into useless kindling as the rhino passes through it and
   into the room beyond. The room beyond the doorway is huge (over
   a 100 feet across and half as high), lit up by dozens of small light
   spells about the room. A 40 foot tall impressive looking statue of a goblin
   god fills most of the back wall. A chanting goblin wizard stands before
   the statue doing something. Almost fifty spear totting goblins stand in
   a group in the center of the room, now turning to face you. High on a ledge
   (30 feet up) to your immediate upper right you see about two
   dozen skeletons changed to stone pillars (wrapped tightly with thick log
   chains). Three of those two dozen pillars hold your friends (Mikey,
   Kopfy, and Jax), hooded and chained. Just inside the door on either side
   stand two large (15 foot tall) slow moving stone golums.
   <p>
   Vortex charges on into the room and gores the first goblin he meets.
   What does everyone do next?

   Suddenly, without warning, and taking the three
   chained adventurers completely by surprise, Mike's
   incessant shrieks are squelched by a tremendous
   crash, followed by sounds of trampling, and a
   distinctly goblin death cry, cut short.
   <p>
   Jax is impressed by the echoes. "Whoa, this place

   [[Taran]] Stepping on splintered wood with his
   standard issue orc boots, Taran sizes up the
   situation from just outside the room and takes
   charge as Vortex sets about on his rampage.
   "Lilac, you gotta buzz up there," he shouts to
   the fairy, who wisely flitted high into the air
   as Vortex rampaged into the crowd of goblins,
   "and free them!" Taran steals a glance
   at the trembling hobbit whose eyes are wide with
   astonishment at the seemingly overwhelming odds.
   "Get ready to run, Shipy!"
   <p>
   The orc warrior takes aim at the head wizard
   and with dispatch lets loose his recently
   cranked, seek-enchanted bolt.
   <p>
   [L0SR vs Dex for seek enchantment to work:
   2,4=6 + Dex(11) = 17 &gt; 15. Good enough!]
   <p>
   As Taran's enchanted bolt whistles toward the
   wizard across the room, the orc roars the ancient
   Dracon war-cry in its native orcish tongue to
   signal his presence to his brother and the
   chained wizards. He quick-swaps his crossbow for
   the bastard sword bequeathed to him by his Uncle
   (may he rest in peace). Feeling uncomfortable
   with the situation inside the corridor--with
   goblin spears no doubt ready to fly into the
   corridor and nowhere to run but back, he reports
   his thoughts to the hobbit. "It's either stay
   here and get turned into a pin cushion, or we
   charge the goblins..."
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "...and get turned into pin cushions!
   Damnit, Tar, I'm a thief, not a maniac!" Shipy
   quips as he swings toward the fray his sling
   staff, which coughs a stone straight into the
   mass of confused and trampled goblins.
   <p>
   [[Taran]] Taran wonders how long the golums
   will stay immobile, and if Lilac will be
   successful in her mission to free the other
   half of their troupe. "Hang in there, Jax..."

   Khara_Khang...(continues)&lt;======)==O 
   <p>
   [[GM]] The fired seek-enchanted crossbow bolt (aimed at the goblin
   wizards head) zips across the room. Just before reaching the wizard
   the bolt makes a square turn, heading back to the person who fired it
   (Taran), no doubt by some magic protection. In no more than a
   second (from the time it is fired until it returns), the seek-enchanted
   crossbow bolt sinks feather deep into Taran’s upper chest (take 7 hits).
   The pain of the bolt is like the touch of a glowing hot piece of metal.
   Vortex continues his rampage amongst the (40 some) goblins gathered
   in the center of the room. Snorting at the painful jabs from spears
   Vortex gores and tramples as if it was his birthday (goring and trampling
   being a happy time for any Rhino). One of the two (15 foot tall) slow
   moving stone Golum’s turns to intercept Taran and Shipy while the
   other heads towards the Rhino. Taran and Shipy easily dodge the slow
   moving stone Golum (with Shipy dodging between its legs), heading
   into the room.
   <p>
   The (40 foot tall) impressive looking stone statue of a goblin god which
   fills most of the back wall begins producing a thick mist from its
   cupped hands. As the thick mist flows out into the room in front of the
   statue a new goblin appears (every 2 rounds, barbed spear in hand).
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] Flying up and away from the fray the she heads directly towards
   (Mike, Kopfy, and Jax), who are still chained to three different
   stone pillars. Among the two dozen other pillars she see’s many other
   skeletons similarly chained (and some bodies in various states of
   decay). Being naturally resistance to magic, when Lilac approaches each
   of her three captured friends her presence somehow breaks
   whatever spells which holds them, causing their chains and hoods to fade
   into nothingness. "Hi boys! It looked liked you needed saving!"
   says Lilac giggling, buzzing her wings loudly, and then pirouetting in the
   air to look down at the havoc some thirty feet below.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] (back down below).. "Gezz Taran... I thought I was the only one
   you ever shot. Now you went and shot yourself! I only have one
   healing potion left, and y’d have to get that bolt out of ya first!"
   chirps the Hobbit, running beside Taran and noticing how deep the
   crossbow bolt is imbedded.
   <p>
   [[Taran]] Foamy blood starts running freely from the sides of your mouth
   and you begin to start having trouble breathing. Looking ahead
   (about the room), you see seven goblins charging towards you and Shipy and
   one of the Golums following behind you.
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Happy just to be free, his voice
   almost horse from shrieking, Michael rushes over to the (30 foot high)
   parapet and withdraws his wand. Pointing it down towards the goblins he
   considers doing a quip or witticism first, but remembers he quit
   doing those. Pushing the small black button on his wand, energy explodes
   from its tip. Seconds later the sparkling energy congeals into
   millions of small white thumb-sized butterflies (still 25 feet above the
   heads of the goblins). As if they were unified in a plan, the swirling
   mass of butterflies head downward.
   <p>
   [[Kopy]] Raising his hand Kopfy begins a spell. His brow furrowed in
   concentration.
   <p>
   [[Jax]] Freed, Jax races off to help his bother, heading toward the stairs.

   Jax unsheaths his blade with a metallic zing that

   His heightened intelligence having succumbed to
   blind rage at the sight of Taran's blood, he

   [[GM]] Bounding down the steep stairs several at a time, you (Jax)
   jump the last few, landing flat-footed on the floor of the main room in a
   full sprint. Dodging the first spear thrown at you, your wide blade takes
   the head cleanly off the first goblin you meet, and the arm off the
   second goblin who attempts to impede you. As you reach your brother in arms
   (Taran) you see he is coughing up thick blood and has one
   of his own enchanted bolts sticking out of his chest (very deeply).
   Shipy stands beside him, weapon in hand and wall-eyed with fear.
   Looking up you see millions of small thumb-sized white butterflies
   swooping downward en masse as dozens of goblins rush toward your
   position. A large stone golum is also moving in your direction.

   [[Taran]] Taran curses the wizard whose magic
   must have reversed the enchantment placed on
   his crossbow bolts, but in loyalty does not
   curse Arahk Gnahk's sorcery at having been
   painfully corrupted. "'Once an Agent of the
   shaman Arahk Gnahk, always an Agent!' At least
   that's what Arahk told us before we parted
   company," Taran remembers with fondness. His
   wound makes him cough and he spits blood. "Head
   isn't spinning yet, that's a good sign," he
   mutters to Shipy who slows a bit to face the
   oncoming orcs.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Speaking of signs, how about one for
   EXIT, ork?" the hobbit manages nervously.
   <p>
   [[Taran]] "Nothing yet, but at least we'll
   have some <cough> help--check it out upstairs!"
   <p>
   Orc and hobbit glance up and realize that Lilac
   has freed Jax, Michael and Kopfy. They also
   see the swarm of butterflies.
   <p>
   The wounded orc finds his strength ebbing away,
   but continues with Shipy to put some distance
   between them and the Golum grinding behind them.
   At the same time they angle toward the south wall,
   away from the bulk of the goblins. Taran clutches 
   the bolt buried in his chest with his left arm,
   and spies his brother clamboring down the stairs.
   "We gotta hold out 'til the heavy hitter arrives,
   Shipy!"
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Eat rock, goblin scum!" Shipy cries
   as he hurls another sling stone at their
   approaching goblin foe.
   <p>
   [[Taran] His crossbow needing too much time and
   strength, neither of which he has, the coughing
   Taran pulls out the engraved axe from
   his belt with his right hand and painfully throws
   it at the nearest goblin, just as he spies his
   brother bounding down the stairs. "Hurry, Jax,"
   he thinks to himself, re-equipping his sword,
   too heavy to swing with one arm, or two weakened
   arms at that, "now the rescuers need rescuing!"

   <p>
   Hacking his way through the swarming mass of
   goblins, Jax reaches his brother and Shipy.
   One look at the embedded bolt in Taran's chest
   steels Jax for the worst. Standing between Taran
   and the goblins, Jax yells "Shipy! Get that
   potion handy, dude!" Then to his brother, "Quick, 
   how many goblins are there?"
   <p>
   As Taran struggles with the non sequitur, the
   hobbit replies woefully, "Yes, but it won't
   do any good with the bolt---ah, nevermind, here!"
   Shipy was interrupted by a horrible Orcish scream:
   Jax had ripped the wayward bolt out of Taran's
   chest while he was distracted!
   <p>
   Quickly, Jax pours half of Shipy's elixir into the 
   deep wound, and the rest into Taran's open maw.
   "I suggest you fight hand-to-hand, T!" Jax whips
   around reclaiming his scimitar, as his brother
   sinks to the wall to catch his breath. As he
   launches himself into the oncoming attackers with
   near-suicidal vengeance, Jax hopes Kopfy's
   spell packs a heavy punch....

   [[GM]] Michael of the Midnight Magicks smiles widely as his wayward
   thumb-sized butterflies swarm down into the room. What few
   know (including Michael), is that the small white (pretty) butterflies
   are carnivorous blood sucking insects with only one goal in mind, to eat
   and drink from goblin flesh. All the goblins (save the wizard, who has
   protection against them), scream out in pain and stop doing whatever
   they were doing as millions of butterflies swarm in attacking. Their
   small razor-like teeth seeking out soft goblin skin. Not one single butterfly
   attacks anyone except a goblin. "Now that’s a thing of beauty!" Michael
   colloquy’s to himself.
   <p>
   The potion Taran imbibed does its work very quickly, and Taran’s damage
   disappears almost instantly. Giving back the breath and strength
   he had lost to the enchanted bolt which could have very well killed him.
   A single (15 foot tall) Golum moves in on Taran, Jax, and Shipy.
   Looking up Shipy see’s Kopfy is still working his spell while the
   butterflies and Rhino (Vortex) are killing goblins by the dozens, but the
   goblin god statue is creating more.

   [[GM]] The door (at the top right of the map) suddenly bursts open and
   in charges a non-descript human warrior of shorter than average
   height holding a Misericorde in one hand. Seeing what is happening he
   slides to a stop as the door swings back shut behind him. The (15
   foot tall) golum who had been attempting to attack the very mobile and
   elusive rhino (Vortex) turns toward the new arrival (the human
   warrior named Mak). The golum also attempts to protect the wizard as he
   first moves between the two, and then advances on the new
   warrior with the intent of smashing the puny human into little tiny
   squishy yukey bits. What do you do Mak?

   From the high balcony (30 feet up) above Kopfy’s spell is released upon
   the room, as the room erupts into chaos. Without warning the
   entire room begins shaking as the (40 foot tall) impressive looking
   (50 ton) stone statue of a Goblin God (against the back wall) begins
   vibrating, and cracks begin appearing on its surface everywhere.

   fear of interupting his concentration. (I also truly admire Mikes blood
   thirsty butterflies a little to much :D ) While I am hovering,
   I notice an object lying on the floor next to Kopfys feet. Fluttering down,

   [[GM]] Since the golum is moving as Lilac fires her lightning bolt,
   her aim is off just a wee bit. The lightning bolt slams into the golum’s
   left leg (somewhere between his knee and thigh), shattering it, and sending
   the golum falling backwards to the floor, smashing at least a half
   dozen goblins in the process (and many blood-sucking butterflies as well).
   As the golum impacts the stone floor the animate stone creature
   shatters into pieces. Casting the lightning bolt so close above the

   rockers). A fact they easily notice.

   [[GM]] Cutting a path through the goblins, who are beginning to die in
   large groups (due to butterfly bites, yes that’s what I said). Taran,
   Jax, and Shipy surround the goblin wizard, who is still recovering from
   an eight-ball to the top of the head (Michael’s doing). As the three
   prepare to transpierce the stunned wizard the mighty (40 foot tall, 50 ton)
   stone statue of a goblin god begins toppling forward. Looking
   up towards Kopfy, Shipy see him waving his arms as if something is about to
   land. Accidentally kicking the black eight-ball at his feet Shipy
   picks it up. A large shadow looms over the four as the stone statue
   begins its fall to the floor. What do the three of you do?

   Boy was he ever wrong! "Stand still you little miscreant! I can’t smash
   you if you keep moving you little piss ant!" booms the golum in a
   thunderous voice, as you dodge back and forth along the wall avoiding his
   deadly foot. Your insignificant stones do little except anger the golum
   ever further. Pausing for a moment the golum turns to look at the
   wizard as the 40 foot tall stone statue representing a goblin god begins
   toppling forward. You have but a few moments to flee past the
   golum as he is momentarily distracted. What do you do
   (make sure you look at the map)?

   [Al_Tjm] Mak, now seeing he has a chance to preserve his overweight
   body as "chunky" and not "pasty" (under a Golum's foot), decides
   to flee with the others. Barring that, he stuffs his sling back into his
   belt and draws out his rope, pre-tied to a noose. If the golum tries to
   stomp him, Mak reasons, he'll dodge between the golum's legs,
   snare the raised foot, and hopefully lead the hopping golum under the
   crashing goblin idol. This, of course, is a last-chance effort that has

   run at full break neck speed, heading toward retreating party
   members (Shipy, Taran, and Jax) who are also running for the stairs at the
   southeastern corner of the room. As you sprint away the golum
   turns and follows you. As you race past the stunned goblin wizard
   (who was hit by Mike’s black eight-ball) you stiff arm him, sending him
   sprawling to the floor. Looking over your shoulder as you continue running
   you see the 40 foot stone statue representing a goblin god
   topple forward, smashing the golum (who was to slow to get out of the way)
   and the goblin wizard who never had a chance to get out of the away.

   on that Golem. Me an' my ever-stinkin' brother
   here are in for the loot too, though bashing a few
   goblin skulls has been pretty fulfilling as well."

   [[Mak]] "Yyyeah... I'm not too fond of goblins either.
   Especially not angry ones.
   <p>
   "So... uh... about how much loot are you in for?
   In my rush to get some work, I didn't ask about my payment.
   <p>
   "I'm content with just enough to get by.
   <p>
   "Just curious." Mak smirks convincingly, and offers Jax a bit of hard-tack.

   Sitting on Jax's shoulder (when hobby snibbed my lizards I moved to
   someone who appreciates my cooking) while I munched on my tastey
   lizards, I listen to Mak's talking. Fishing for another one, I toss it in
   the air and giggle in glee as Vortex grabs it and gobbles it down.

   <blockquote><hr>
   Jax is too busy munching on sun-dried lizards (they're all the rage in
   Khazan now). "Mmmff. Nice flavour, these. What'dya call the sauce
   you used on 'em, Lilac?" Then he notices Mak's furtive glances around the
   troupe.<hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   "Oh, my special own blend of some herbs and spices, finely chopped veggies
   and all sauted in a pan with green-amber wyne. I am pleased
   you like it!" I say with a big smile on my face (you can tell I am very
   pleased).
   <p>
   "Hey Mak, my name is Lilac and I am from Moonstone Cove in Misty Wood.
   Wanna sun-dried lizard? They be very tastey! (hold one out
   towards Mak) By the way, we are gonna find loot? Wow, I thought this whole
   thing was just for the fun of it!! Guess I am just here for the
   thrill of it all although a few coins wouldn't hurt to bad I think, esp.
   if I have Vortexy with me." Bites the head off of her lizard and munches
   contently.
