   [[GM]] Slowly the magical floating rug (with Jax, Taran, Mike,
   Kopfy, Shipy, Mak, and Lilac on board) makes its way
   out of the sewer, following the new spiral stairs discovered by Mak.
   Within fifteen minutes all of you are in a dead-end
   alley about 200 hundred yards south of where you first entered
   the sewer system (forced to roll up the rug) and climb
   out of the man-hole cover into the dark alley (and carry everything
   else). Outside you see it has just become dark.
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] "It's great to be outside again
   guys. This would be a great place for an ambush
   wouldn’t it," I say, looking around and smiling.
   <p>
   [[Shipy]] "Hey... as party leader I don't find that very funny.
   I say we get our shik and get out of here as quick as
   possible!" Looking up at the roof top with a worried look.

   Not willing to concede that they are home-free,
   but also not wanting to look like a sniper
   waiting to practice his trade, Taran packs his
   crossbow into its leather strap (holster) on
   his back; but, he keeps his hand on his sword,
   sheathed, and keeps a look-out for any lingering
   creatures that go bump (and slash, growl) in
   the night.
   <p>
   "If you want, we can stash our "evidence" in
   our warren for the night, and camp out there,"
   Taran offers, getting a nod from his brother.
   "It isn't exactly The Hotel Khazan or anything,
   but it'll do until morning until we can confront
   Huros."

   "Once we're settled, we should discuss strategy

   [[GM]] Out of the shadows walks Captain Huros, a wide smile on his face.
   He is flanked by two large trolls who also
   work for the city. The roof tops suddenly come alive with men as they
   all stand up on que (like in some Hollywood
   movie). Many of them hold crossbows trained on you. On the rooftops
   and at the open end of the alley you count at
   least 60 men, not counting the two war-trolls. "I’m glad you guys
   care so much that you would talk about me. That
   questionable remark really hurt Jax," says Captain Huros smiling.
   "Why put off what we can do now! Did I mention I
   was also going to have to place a city-tax on your treasure?"
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] "You no I was just kidding
   about that ambush remark," I say swallowing hard, and
   suddenly thinking I’m way too young to die.

   [[Lilac]] Still sitting on Shipy's shoulder I turn invisible and
   fly over and land on Jax's shoulder, pulling out my new wand.

   What he says, however is...

   Taran makes no aggressive move, thankful that
   he put away his crossbow so as not to look very

   better part of valor, and keeps Jax in his

   <p>
   Jax feels the whisper-wind of the faery's wings
   brush his neck as she undoubtedly lands on his
   shoulder, though he can't see her. He bears
   more than her weight on his shoulders, however.
   Once again, the party's fate is at the mercy of
   his next words as their treacherous city captain,
   the bastard who sent on their mission, singles him
   out. "Why can't they pick on our party leader?"
   he complains softly to Taran.
   <p>
   "Yeah, so much for talking strategy," his brother
   moans.
   <p>
   Jax scratches his head through his leather helmet.
   "I'm getting frakkin tired of this diplomacy
   nonsense," go his thoughts, harmonizing with the
   words of his father's pre-battle mantra, "Dracons
   decapitate first, question later," which ricochet
   inside his skull. Oother Pe'ng Dracon's words may
   have consoled him before, but now they trouble
   him. His thoughts hadn't troubled him before
   that cursed Haroouugh had sharpened Jax's brain
   (and scimitar). "Enough!" Jax's muscles cried
   out, halting his brain's spiral into self-pity.
   Captain Huros spoke before his brain could
   respond with, "Hey, since when do muscles talk?"

   As he popped his hood, Lilac suddenly bursts into

   [[GM]] "If that be your choice, and to think I only wished to take
   your money... not your lives." Wishing it had not come
   to violence, Captain Huros (like any good Khazan scout) was always
   prepared. With a click of his fingers the roof top
   (both sides), which was lined with crossbow men, open fire.
   In a split second they fill the alley with a hail of crossbow
   bolts. Captain Huros steps back between the two war-trolls
   which fill the end of the alley like a well jammed cork.
   <p>
   Shipy, Michael, Kopfy, go down with three crossbow bolt in each
   of them. Mak is hit once in the leg but remains
   standing. Taran is hit twice (once in the shoulder, once in the right leg).
   <p>
   [Taran - Roll a level 1 SR against Dex to remain standing.]
   <p>
   Jax and Lilac are not hit in this first volley.
   <p>
   "Reload and prepare to fire a second volley if they do not stop
   this instant!" shouts Captain Huros from behind the two
   trolls.

   and hears Captain Huros order his troops to
   reload. With no tricks up his sleeve, and
   no idea how his brother is going to save them
   all, all he can but do is lie and gape. He
   tries to regain his footing if only to regain

   [[GM]] Taran slowly stands using a the wall to hold him up.
   A third crossbow bolt buries itself deeply in Taran’s gut
   (fired from a slow to react guard). In wicked pain Taran slides down
   the wall, blood washing the surrounding stone freely. From somewhere
   at about roof top level a huge burst of flame explodes from no
   where (actually from the invisible Lilac). The sudden gout of flame
   covers a huge (40 by 100 foot) area acting like napalm (i.e. a sticky
   jelled continuous burning fuel source). Dozens of guards are instantly
   engulfed in flames which they cannot put out. The strong winds push
   the flames as they spread wildly and uncontrollably across the rooftops.
   <P>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] Bleeding like a gutted pig
   from several deep chest wounds from the crossbow bolts
   Michael pulls out his wand, point it straight up in the air and pushes
   the button. Screeching at the top of his lungs he yells,
   "SPOON!! SPOON!! SPOON!!"
   <P>
   [[GM]] Dozens of large missile type fireworks shoot out of the end of
   Michael’s wand. They each soar hundreds of feet into air leaving
   bright tails in there wake. As they return back to the ground they
   each explode into huge fireballs setting houses and buildings on
   fire in thunderous explosions. One of returning missiles strikes
   the nearby building shower the Trolls and men at the mouth of the
   alley with large stones. Stones which smash heads and shatter bones when
   they hit.  Michael collapses into unconsciousness, his energy spent,
   but not quite dead. Jax’s sword cuts a deep groove in one of
   the trolls as it attempts to cover itself from the falling debris,
   and it howls out in rage and pain. The thick dust also
   makes Jax become visible. Using strength he didn’t know he still had
   Kopfy with Mak’s help forces himself to stand
   (even though heavily wounded). Together Kopfy and Mak unroll the magic
   rug, pull Shipy (who is badly wounded but
   awake), Taran, Michael, and the chest onto it. All of which are within
   arms reach of each other.
   <P>
   Across the city in a impressive palace of pure elegance the Death
   Goddess herself notices the explosions in the distance
   from her balcony, explosions within her city. Lerotra’hh
   turns to a gray haired wizard. "Assemble the strike team NOW!
   You have two minutes to get there! I’m going too!" she commands,
   her words dripping like venom.

   It was all happening so suddenly! Kopfy and Mike
   "the Tick" of the MM must have come through with
   some magic! And that fireball must have been from 
   Lilac's new toy! (Wow, he had to get him one of
   those.)

   But Jax knows that the ruckus they're causing will 
   attract more attention. From his goddess'
   parapets, the conflagration would surely be
   visible and disconcerting.

   His opponents momentarily stunned from the bite
   of rocks and his EverSharp(TM) blade, Jax tries
   unsuccessfully to find Lilac in the smoke, while
   dodging falling debris. He glimpses the others
   piling onto the unfurled carpet, and the chalky
   dust that covers him.
   <p>
   Well, maybe they could escape before attracting
   too much attention, but at the moment, Jax had a
   War-Troll or two to tend to. He hopes that the
   Death Goddesses' police will recognize him and
   Taran as her former agents, if it comes to that.

   [[GM]] The chalky dust also covers Lilac and she, too, becomes visible.
   Speaking the command word to activate it,
   Kopfy’s magical rug lifts to a height of about three feet and continues
   rising. The buildings on both sides of the alley are
   covered with growing flames. You hear the screams of dead and and
   soon to be dead, wishing their death to be less
   painful. Jax jumps back barely avoiding a crushing death blow from one
   of the two war-trolls. One troll bleeds heavily
   from Jax’s EverSharp(TM) blade. Captain Huros is on the ground
   between them, knocked down and covered with debris.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "Damnit Jax we’re leaving here NOW! Come on!" yells Kopfy,
   spitting up blood with each forced word.

   [[GM]] Mak and Kopfy hold out their hands to help you aboard if you
   decide to join them. You can see death in all of

   for this night, unless you are still around to take it for him....

   The magic carpet suddenly bursts through the
   billowing smoke behind Jax, just as he dodges the
   war-troll's club. "Dudes!" Jax exclaims, taking
   Mak's hand as Kopfy grabs his shoulder armor.
   More subdued and apologetic as they haul him
   aboard, Jax says, "Thanks guys. Sorry for getting
   you into this mess."
   <p>
   He checks to see that his brother is on board, if
   not fully conscious, and spies Lilac zipping in
   and out of the smoke columns. As he makes his
   way over to Taran, he yells, "C'mon Lilac! We're

   [[GM]] Taran groans in pain (on his last hit point...
   heehe). Even loaded to the brim with people and items,
   the large magical rug effortlessly lifts up and away
   from the burning building increasing its speed as the
   heat from the flames nearly lights your clothes on fire.
   Now an entire city block is engulfed in a 10 alarm fire
   the likes Khazan has not seen in years.  Few see your
   magical rug pass overhead in the darkness of the night
   once the flames are in the distance.
   <P>

   grabs the edge of the rug and is pulled along far faster than she
   could ever fly (and that's fast).

   pointing to an alley many blocks away. "I know a gypsy
   healing lady who will help us."

   [[GM]] Minutes later all of you are inside the elderly
   gypsy lady’s home and safe. Everyone who was wounded now
   rests on their own cot completely healed (with all crossbow
   bolts having been removed). Your treasure is beside you
   within reach. The gypsy lady is a gray haired woman with
   dozens of trinkets around her neck and dressed in brightly
   colored clothes. Walking over to the now healed Shipy
   she leans forward and slaps his hobbitoid face with a
   resounding ‘POP’. "You weaselly little Hobb. Did you forget
   you stiffed me on my last healing job! I’ll give to something
   to bleed about!" Before Shipy can receive a second slap,
   he’s off his cot running on his hands and knees (as only a
   Hobbit can), scuttling under Taran’s cot for protection.
   Muttering something about the woman being crazy at that she
   can kiss his furry a...

   one arm leaning against Taran's cot and the other
   busily swiping at Shipy, who is cowering close to
   the wall underneath the same cot.

   "I'll take what you owe me outta your hide!" she
   shrieks in Taran's ear.
   <p>
   "What, huh? Didn't see me! Didn't do it! Can't
   prove a thing!" Taran blurts, bolting up. "Oh,
   heh-heh," he grinned sleepily.
   <p>
   Jax sighs, puts down his blade and walks over to
   attempt to defuse the situation. "Ma'am, just
   how much does our little Hobbit owe you?"

   for a minute to look at Jax and put her hands on
   her hips. Realizing the Hobbit is out of reach for the moment.
   "The Hobb owes 17 gold lions n' 1 silver eagle, and now
   24 gold n’ 4 silver more for my services with you all tonight.
   If he doesn’t pay this time I’m putting a curse on his little
   ass. Can you pay?"

   [[Kopfy]] "We should pay her off and collect our stuff and head to
   the Blue Frog Tavern. I have a key to the 'Common Room' in the back

   Michael's smile almost falters when he sees the latge form of
   Capt. Huros at the end of the bar. Who looks up from his
   conversation with a rather weasely looking snitch to say.
   <p>
   "Ah my boy! I am glad to see you made it!" And smiles broadly.
   "I was just looking for your merry band of adventurers."

   "Well where have you been?" He says, "We've been asking all over

   slimeball when I had the chance. Lerotra'hh must
   have arrived, he must've come up with some excuse,
   and then convinced the goddess to heal him.
   Wonder if he fingered us?"

   Taran chimes in, restraining his brother, who had
   half a mind to introduce Huros to his
   EverSharp(TM) blade. "Jax, don't you think we
   should lay low for a while just in case he did
   blame it all on us?"
   <p>
   Kopfy offers, "If he *did*, our cover's blown now
   anyway, thanks to Mike."

   "Hey!" Michael protests, resisting the urge to
   quip.

   Lilac adds her two bits: "i don't think he could
   have blamed us. we would only have more reason
   to expose his treachery! i think he's waiting
   for us to make the next move. what do u think,
   Jax?" <p>
   The orc warrior nods, weighing the probabilities.
   Looking around the room, he asks, "Where's Shipy?" 
   <p>
   Mak resumes the thread, "So what are you
   suggesting, sprite, we blackmail this bastard? I
   like!"
   <p>
   Suddenly, a loud thud is heard across the room,
   where their loot is stashed. It is accompanied
   by the tinkling of gold coins. A muffled "Ouch!"
   is heard, then a stifled cry, distinctly Hobbish.
   <p>
   Taran emerges from the shadows, lifting up Shipy
   by the scruff of his neck. "Whatever we do, we'd
   better divvy this loot quickly. Shipy's getting
   restless, and dived into the chest!"

   happiness. Then, he notices Mak who is feeling
   a bit left out. While he didn't step in until
   the last, Taran feels he should be given some
   share. "Mak, lemme buy you a drink and a meal,
   once this is all over. Also, I think I speak
   for everyone here in saying thanks for helping
   us out with that last battle--why don't you
   take your pick of the weapons we seem to have
