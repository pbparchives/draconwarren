   [[Taran]] With each bite of lizard parts, Taran
   winces. Every few minutes, he holds his slightly
   shiny bastard sword in front of him and checks
   his reflection in paranoia. "Once you've been a
   lizard," he thinks to himself, "you'll never
   eat sun-dried <ulp> lizards again."
   <p>
   Taran happily surveys the aftermath of the battle,
   and not feeling particularly hungry, stands
   and addresses the group. "Well done, to all,"
   he offers with a salute. "I'm gonna head
   downstairs and see what's left. I'll leave
   the obvious treasure room," he adds, gesturing
   the door atop the landing, "with all its traps,
   to the sneakier types." He winks at the hobbit.
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] "Here's your bolt, Mr. SniperOrc!" The
   fairy flits to Taran as he passes her from atop
   her orc-perch. "I found it near one of the
   pillars."
   <p>
   [[Taran]] "Thanks, Ms. Fairy, and thanks for
   freeing my brother so he could save my green
   hide." He slides the bolt into his enchanted
   quiver. Passing Mak, he whispers, "Welcome
   to the party, hu-mann." He bares his tusks
   in a toothy smile of welcome.
   <p>
   Once downstairs, Taran sees if there is anything
   salvagable from the slain goblins' possessions.

   <p>
   [[GM]] Searching through the grisly smashed and bloodied goblin bodies
   like a vulture at dinner time you (Taran) find the following items;
   54 gold lions, 13 silver eagles, and 6 copper stars. Within the crumbled
   remains of the Golum you find a single ruby the size of a Hobbit’s
   fist. Holding it up you notice it sparkles brightly. The other golum was
   crushed under the 40 ton statue, so thoughts of finding a second ruby
   are quickly forgotten. You also find; a set of bone dice, a necklace totem
   to some goblin god, a small book titled ‘101 Ways To Prepare A
   Fairy’, dozens of barbed spears, and one black stove pipe hat. This takes
   you about fifteen minutes of searching.
   <p>
   At the same time Taran heads down stairs the rest of the group approaches
   the wooden door in the southeast corner of the balcony. Taking
   his time Shipy finds no traps (on the door), but yet the door itself is
   locked, even though the door has no keyhole to lock. Waving his hand
   (Kopfy) and speaking several ancient words of power the door swings open
   by magic. Standing in the doorway everyone looks into the
   very fancy (20 by 20 foot) wizards chamber (see map for details).
   What does everyone do?

   [[Taran]] Taran snatches up the booty as he
   finds it, including the hat. He leaves the
   spears where they lie, glad that their tips
   never met his hide, and in some solemn way,
   respects a warrior's last honor to lie
   dead with his weapon at his side. Pocketing
   the cookbook, he smiles to himself as he thinks
   about what Lilac would say upon seeing it, and
   what kind of sarcastic remark Michael would have
   for the situation.
   <p>
   [[If, while Taran is scavenging, the others
   enter the wizard room to investigate, Taran will
   climb half-way up the stairs and wait for them
   to finish, keeping watch with his crossbow and
   cranked bolt at the ready.]]

   Were this the Jax of old, before he joined up with
   Lerotra'hh to battle the Death Goddess's enemies,
   he might have boldly strode into the room, and
   sized it up from within. But the last time his
   impetuousness got the better of him, he ended up
   plunging into a hidden pool filled with stale beer
   and jellyfish, and that really sucked big time.
   If delving through Gristlegrim those many moons
   ago had taught him anything, it was the value of
   patience and restraint.
   <p>
   Jax asks Kopfy, "OK, nice trick with the door.
   Now where's the magic? Surely a wizard's lair
   will be magically trapped?" He taps the floor
   inside the room with his scimitar to check that
   the floor is not illusionary.

   <p>
   [[GM]] Tapping the floor Jax finds it to be real. Shipy, Kopfy, and Mike
   move into the room first. Inside the (20 by 20 foot) room you see
   a table with five chairs. A beautiful gold/green and red rug beneath it.
   Two book shelves filled with books. A phoenix symbol/flag hanging
   from one wall. Beside it stands a golden candelabra, an over stuffed chair
   (with a foot stool). Beside it on the wall hangs a small picture. On
   the other side of the door hangs a cloak, and a large wooden chest beside it.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] "I don't do tricks, that's Michael of the Midnight Magicks area
   of expertise. Not all traps need to be magical or mechanical Jax to
   be deadly."
   <p>
   [[Michael of the Midnight Magicks]] "Hey.... I resemble that remark,"
   giving Kopfy a wide grin.
   <p>
   [[Kopfy]] Scrutinizing the room closely with detect magic I say, "The rug
   is magical, as is three books on the shelf, the cloak, and the
   chest."
   <p>

   somewhere!" I motion for Jax to come inside.

   flattened underneath a goblin-god statue. We're

   but you went and touched his stuff and now I have to kill ya.
   Nothing personal... really. Yeah, that is a really nice chair I have.
   I'll try to make quick and painless as possible, unless you like pain. I'm

   <p>
   Jax takes one look at the Demon....
   Apparently the Demon *liked* the goblin wizard,
   for Jax had just revealed to him that the wiz
   was dead. So taking the "but wait a second, he's
   dead, so you're *free*!" approach was out of the
   question. "Why did I hafta go an' touch this
   confounded cloak?" he thinks.
   <p>
   Jax takes one look at his EverSharp(TM) blade....
   He hadn't used its Haroouugh-sharpened vorpal
   edge yet. As of late, it seemed to activate only
   once a day. Maybe Shipy would get to see how it
   works after all.
   <p>
   Jax takes one look at Lilac....
   Perhaps his last look? He wouldn't be able to
   live without her... sun-dried lizards. Wow,
   they were good. "Sheesh, thinking wif' me
   stomach again," Jax thinks in his best imitation
   of Pnahk.
   <p>
   Jax takes one look at the door....
   Taran is behind that door. Well, at least his
   ever-stinkin' brother wouldn't *see* him die.
   Seeing Taran meet his fiery death, crushed beneath
   a fallen Balrog back during the siege of Khazan
   was more than even his cruel Orcish heart could
   take. He wished his brother would just take his
   loot and run.
   <p>
   It was clobberin' time. But they must make the
   Demon visible to the others somehow. Perhaps
   Lilac's bolt would make the Demon visible again,
   or at the least make him glow. It was worth a
   shot. If not, well, it was "a good day to die,"
   as his uncle said. Once. He flexed his sinews,
   gripped his scimitar and tensed to spring into
   action.

   accident right?"<hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   Frowning inwardly at the faerie's impossibly bad
   aim, Jax reaches for a reply, but no witty quip
   emerges from his brain's quip-neurons. Actually,
   one neuron (you mean there's more?) does
   manufacture "Faeries: can't live with 'em, can't
   swipe at 'em", but the gravity of the situation
   prevents this quip from being unleashed into
   Trollworld. Too bad.
   <p>
   Instead Jax realizes that there was still a chance
   to prevent what would surely be a bloody mess.
   With the odds evened just a tad by Kopfy's spell,
   and given the Demon's expressed interest in his
   EverSharp(TM) blade, there were a host of new
   probabilities.
   <p>
   "So, Good Sir Demon, you like?" Jax hefts his
   scimitar, making sure it glinted nicely. His
   guts wrenched with what he was going to say next.
   His swordarm's muscles cringed and protested, "No
   way dude! You're cr---" Jax interrupted his
   muscles and continued calmly, "Cuts
   through brass like butter!"
   <p>
   Then in his most threateningly cunning voice,
   "Wanna make a deal?"

   [[GM]] "No deals Orc (talking to Jax), I only deal death," says the demon.
   Stepping forward to attack Jax cuts a deep groove from the
   demons neck to his waist in one motion with his EverSharp(TM) blade.
   Unfortunately to Jax’s astonishment the death dealing wound heals
   itself instantly (Think ‘Terminator II’ the movie). Stepping forward the
   demon twists the blade from Jax’s hand, letting it fall to the floor.
   Taking Jax by the throat the demon tosses Jax across the room,
   where he lands on the table and then falls off onto the floor on the other
   side. Take (4 hits). Hidden under the table not far from where you end up
   landing (or quit falling) you see Shipy under the table looking
   back at you, like a mouse looking out of its hole.

   From Jax's description of the demon, Taran is
   both glad he missed the near catastrophe and
   sorry he didn't get to see the firework display
   himself. Nevertheless, he does not feel bashful
   about peering into the chest of weapons to claim
   a souvenir of his own. After all, they need to
   bring back to Captain Huros "proof of their
   endeavors," as Kopfy had boldly stated [[OOC: back
   in post 265]] in the Blue Frog Tavern the night
   they were comissioned.
   <p>
   Taran reaches in and takes the buckler from
   its cluttered hiding spot among the armor and
   weapons stashed in the magic chest. Then he
   thinks back to the descriptions of the items
   Kopfy noted were magical, and queries, "Hey
   Kopfy, what's a 'magical silver Misericorde'
   anyway?"
   <p>
   After any single items of booty are claimed
   by the party, Taran wonders aloud where they're
   going to stash the chest. "I guess we could
   figure out how to fly the rug, and fly us all,"
   he pauses, considering Vortex, "well, most of
   us, anyway," back to town, chest and loot in
   tow....

   everyone's surprise. "Well, solves that problem,"
   Jax deadpans.

   [[Kopfy]]"Sorry Lilac, I know you like him and all,
   but he would starve to death down here if we left him." Turning
   toward Vortex who is following us I speak the ancient words of a spell,
   and 'Unsummon's the Rhino, who disappears in a
   puff of dust."<hr></blockquote>
   <p>
   [[Lilac]] Waving to the spot where Vortex was last visable,
   I whisper a slient goodbye. Sighing, I look at Kopfy,
   "Thanks, that makes me feel better than leaving him down here alone.
   I hope that he is ok there."

   Squareing my shoulders, I start tapping my finger against my lip.
   "Hhhmm.... Even if it is greed and he did sell the stuff to
   the goblin, he really is not making much in the long run because for one,
   he has to pay us, two he's not getting all the stuff
   he sold back because we took our fair share, and three, wouldn't
   the captain make more money in the long run by still
   selling stuff to the goblins. I wonder if his higher ups noticed stuff
   was missing and he needed a scap goat. If that's the
   case, aren't we the scap goats?" Tapping my finger againist my lip again...
   I think to myself, "and I don't trust that new
   guy. His presence might mean something else since he was sent by the
   captain to join us."
