               <h2>Taran Dracon's Treasure Room</h2>
               You stumble into a dusty room with several wooden boxes.
               Inside the boxes you find a wealth of treasure.  At least,
               Taran considers it to be treasure: items once owned by the
               Trollgod himself, but which, over time, the wise Khenn Arrth
               has passed on to the owner of this den!  Artifacts in this
               room, according to Taran's bookkeeping, must meet the
               following criteria: it must have been once owned by the
               Trollgod!  Taran has accumulated more treasure and will one
               day hoard some of it here for unwitting orc cavern spelunkers
               to stumble across... at their own peril!
               <p />
               <a href="index.html">A solitary hallway</a> connects this room
               to the rest of the Warren.

               Taran Dracon first met the Trollgod through the connectivity
               of the Internet in 1995, when both were under
               disguise at Desert Rangers.  At the time, Taran knew nothing
               about Tunnels &amp; Trolls except it was a game designed by
               Ken St. Andre, whom Taran had heard of due to his love of the
               game, <a href="http://wasteland.rockdud.net">Wasteland</a>.
               <p />
               Over the years, Taran learned how much fun T&amp;T was, and
               as he befriended the grumpy Trollgod, found himself the
               recipient of some of Trollgod's treasures, which he has holed
               up here.  (He will now cease talking about himself in the third
               person.)

                  <li>I joined <a href="http://www.trollhalla.com"
                     target="new">Trollhalla</a> in 2002.  Of course, I got
                  a packet of goodies to welcome me to the exclusive club.
                  This might have been my first "prize" from the Trollgod,
                  but I have a sneaking feeling I might have received a card
                  or something before then.  Seven years without any postal
                  mail between us doesn't seem quite right, but perhaps it
                  was so.  Anyway, from what I remember, the welcome packet
                  included an official
                  <a target="new"
                     href="http://www.trollhalla.com/trollstrongbox.php"
                     >Trollhalla gold piece</a>, 
                  an issue of Dark Horse Extra #45 from March 2002, a Senator
                  Kelly for a Mutant Free America campaign pin (which I have
                  at work and need to bring home to scan, of course), a 25 cent
                  Batman comic, a copy of the High Adventure Role-playing
                  Game rules, a Tarot card, a fortune teller paper
                  folding thingy like we used to make as kids,
                  and probably some other stuff.  I'll
                  have to dig up that packet of goodies and see what else
                  might have been in there.  Some of it I had sorted into a
                  different pile of stuff.  The rest I'll have to scan later
                  when I find it.  What I did have is below.

                  <li>At the same time that I paid my initial ten smackers
                  for my Trollhalla membership, I also forked over a few
                  extra gold coins to cover a small donation plus shipping to
                  get "The Last Unicorn" soundtrack on CD.  My sister loved
                  this movie growing up and all of us in the family pretty
                  much had the music memorized.  Apparently it is quite a
                  find, for a German-only released album!  I gave the CD to
                  my sister and scored big points in the 'cool big brother'
                  department, at least I think so!

                  </li>
                  <li>
                  In November of that year, Trollgod mailed me a "for
                  display or review only" copy of Wildstorm Productions'
                  "Deathblow: Byblows" #1 written by Alan Moore, illustrated
                  by Jim Baikie.  I only know the date because I kept the
                  envelope he mailed it in.  (I almost scanned it, but then I
                  realized that would border on weird.  As in, "Okay, that's
                  just weird!")  This artifact has nothing to do with
                  T&amp;T and I now don't remember why now he sent it to me.
                  But I kept it all
                  the same&#151;maybe because inside it features a bald naked
                  woman fighting a machine gun-wielding robot.  What a
                  combination, waugh!  This treasure was not signed (unless
                  you count the envelope), so I guess you'll have to trust me
                  that it was once a Trollgod Treasure.  On to the next item.
                  <p align="center">
                  <a href="images/2002_11_deathblow_byblows_cover.jpg"><img

                     ></a></p>
                  </li>

                  <li>The next item that came to me from the Trollgod
                  actually came from his desert ranger alias (Ranger
                  Moonman?).  Upon asking me if I would like it, on account
                  of my publicly stated devotion toward the game, Ken offered
                  to me his 1-inch thick stack of papers that constituted his
                  original scenario design and map rough drafts, sketches,
                  etc., for the best computer role-playing game of all time,
                  I was floored by his offer and most excitedly accepted.
                  So in November of 2004, I became the proud keeper of Ken's
                  original Wasteland notes.  WOW.  I don't have scans of any of
                  these artifacts yet, but one day I hope to put them all up
                  in some form or another at my Wasteland site,
                  <a href="http://wasteland.rockdud.net"

                  </li>

                  <li>In 2004, as promised by <a target="new"
                     href="http://www.trollhalla.com">Trollhalla</a>'s entry papers,
                  Trollgod sent me a Christmas
                  card</a>.  Why am I keeping all
                  this stuff?  Maybe because I think he's famous and as a
                  collector of way too many things, my collection is worth
                  more if I keep all this stuff from the Trollgod.

                  <li>In February 2005, I received a Supreme Scroll of
                  Trollish Honor awarded to me for winning fifth-prize in the
                  monthly <a href="http://www.trollhalla.com" target="new"
                     >Trollhalla</a> TVP contest.  If you don't know what
                  <a href="http://www.trollhalla.com">Trollhalla</a> or TVP
                  are, then you are missing out on some
                  really geeky gamer fun!  For winning fifth-prize, he sent
                  me a novel: <em>Fossil Hunter</em>, Book Two of the
                  Quintaglio Ascension, by Robert J. Sawyer.  He, or this
                  book, apparently won the Hugo and Nebula Awards.  Wow!  I
                  have kidded him that he needs to now send me book one so I
                  can read the series from scratch.  (He hasn't yet.)
                  Then again, I could always get it from the library.
                  (Perhaps he thought the same thing, as he's a librarian.)
                  And yes, he forgot to sign the scroll.
                  Trust me, it's from him!

                  <li>In June 2005, I received a Lesser Scroll of Trollish
                  Glory awarded to me for being alive and participating.  How
                  generous!  This one was actually signed by our benevolent
                  librarian by day, troll by night.  At this time, I don't
                  recall if I received anything other than the scroll along
                  with it.  But if memory serves me right, it was a Red Sonja
                  comic book preview issue.  Help me corroborate this theory,
                  fellow Trollhallans!  I have that issue tucked away
                  somewhere in my secondary treasure room (attic) so it may
                  take a bit of spelunking on my own part to retrieve it and
                  scan it for this treasure room's pictoral inventory.  I
                  think I placed in the top 20 for TVP, but didn't actually
                  earn a spot in the top 5.

                  </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>In July 2005, I received another Lesser Scroll of
                  Trollish Glory awarded to me for being alive (still) and
                  participating (in Trollhalla).  Truly the generosity of the
                  famed bookkeeper from the American southwest is legendary.
                  Again I don't recall if anything accompanied this scroll.
                  What was Khenn Arrth giving away that month, fellow trolls?
                  Again, I think I placed in the top 20 for TVP,
                  but didn't actually earn a spot in the top 5.  Or did I?
                  Perhaps I will have to consult the Trollwalla archives to
                  find out.

                  </li>

                  <li>Also in July 2005, I forked over some gold coins to get
                  a signed copy of Tunnels &amp; Trolls 5.5th edition.  We
                  had an auction for the first 20 copies or so, and my bid
                  got me the 17th of the first 200 copies printed.  I ended
                  up getting it at cost (plus shipping and handling) so I
                  considered myself fortunate, lucky and still could count
                  myself as frugal.  Whoo hoo!<p />
                  But then, lo and behold, this 5th edition with extras (to
                  make it 5.5th edition) came with some Trollgod special
                  thanks.  I am humbled to be considered one of his "friends
                  in the wider world."  Thanks, Khenn!

                  <li>I believe I placed in the top five of the Trollhalla
                  monthly TVP contest sometime in September or October 2005,
                  because I remember receiving a magazine from Trollgod to
                  commemorate my placement.  It was <em>Realms of
                     Fantasy</em>, the February 2005 issue.  There was a
                  really good article in there about J.M. Barrie, the chap
                  who wrote the Peter Pan mythos.  Also a few short stories
                  and some other articles.  Fun reading and it kept me
                  company for a few days on my commute (via train and bus) to
                  work one week in November.  Sadly I do not still have this
                  treasure, but the memory and its place in the treasure room
                  remain.

                  In January 2006, the Trollgod saw fit to send me a gift for
                  my birthday (hatch-day?).  When asked I suggested a book
                  from his cave would be cool as I'm not taking mass transit
                  to work and have plenty of time to read.  He sent me an
                  Aeon Flux hologram bookmark inside a signed copy of
                  <em>Brother Death</em> by Steve Perry.  Cool!  (And
                  apparently he's accepting back hologram cards as currency
                  for future prizes, so this hologram card may be heading
                  straight back from whence it came shortly.)

                  In February 2006, largely in part due to my archiving (in
                  the "Orchive") of the first two Trollgod Trollhalla
                  adventures, and my editing of some T&amp;T publications
                  assembled by Jim Shipman, I won 2nd prize in the monthly
                  Trollhalla TVP prize.  For this I was awarded a book of
                  Ballads.  What a great little book!

                  As requested by Trollgod of his Trollhalla minions,
                  I traded in my Aeon Flux hologram card, along
                  with a Spider-Man movie hologram card, to receive a Tunnels
                  &amp; Trolls Monsters! Monsters! comic that Trollgod scripted
                  in 1995, drawn by Gilead, and lettered by Stellar.  For one 
                  hologram one got the original "Goblin Dreams" version.
                  For two holograms one got a re-scripted version starring
                  Lumpwart the goblin.
                  For three holograms one would get the original version plus
                  the re-scripted version.  Either through
                  absent-mindedness or as I prefer to think, generosity,
                  Trollgod sent me both for just my two holograms.

                  In July 2006, for no reason that I know of, the Trollgod
                  sent to me "The Troll Brothers Gruuf: A Trollish Fable,"
                  story by Rick Silva and art by Gynn Stella.  This "Tunnels
                  &amp; Trolls mini-comic" is an amusing retelling of "The
                  Three Billy-goats Gruff."
