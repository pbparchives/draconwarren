Dekh grinned weakly. "I can cast That’s a Natty Beard," he told them. "Also Find Object, and Find Person. The trouble is that we
haven’t really lost any objects or people, so it’s a bit hard to find them."
<p />
"You sure Find Object won’t help you find something if you know what it is, but it isn’t really yours?" Vin inquired. "Kinda like,
well, ‘Find me an axe.’ or ‘Find me a diamond. Now that would be a useful spell!"
<p />
"Anyway, Dekh has a point about being too trusting and whatnot." Quogh said, pointing out the obvious. "Since the hidden doors have
led to really tough stuff, maybe we should stick to the obvious ways for a bit. At least until we can scrounge up some useful stuff. I
busted my leopard club on that giant’s thick head."
<p />
"I’ll take what’s behind normal door number one then, Monty!" Dekh said with a laugh as he headed over to the lone "real" door in the
room. "Who’s Monty?" Quogh asked. Vin shrugged, made a funny face, and muttered "Goblins...."
<p />
After a cursory examination, Dekh declared the door to be both unlocked and without traps--at least as far as he could tell. Hearing
no objections from his fellow delvers, he turned the handle and pushed on the door... which opened far easier than he expected.
<p />
A short passage, little longer than needed to accommodate the door, opened into a larger room. How big wasn’t exactly clear, due to
the thick cobwebs that filled the area. There were some unmoving... somethings... on the floor.
<p />
Dekh cleared his throat, and turned towards the trolls. "Cobwebs means spiders, or I’m an elven virgin. Who wants to go first?"

<em>
What shall the delvers do?
<ol>
   <li>Have Quogh lead the way into the room.</li>
   <li>Have Vin lead the way into the room.</li>
   <li>Have Dekh lead the way into the room.</li>
   <li>Choose another unopened secret door. (specify which one)</li>
   <li>Rummage through Dekh's "Delvers Kit" for something. (be specific)</li>
   <li>Go back down the wide corridor towards the entrance.</li>
   <li>Something else.</li>
</ol>
You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice, an example for this turn might be...
"Have Dekh lead the way after casting That's a Natty Beard to disguise himself."
