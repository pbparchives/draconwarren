"AAARRRTTHH!!" The TrollGod’s name reverberated down the corridor as the two mighty trolls charged at the urooks. They were either too
brave (or too stupid) to realize that they should have run away. Instead, the two lead warriors tried to protect the archer.
<p />
Quogh’s mighty smash with the ram-headed maul killed one urook outright. His momentum carried him into the archer, and the crossbow
was knocked out of his grasp. Vin’s inexperience cost him dearly. The urook was quickly inside his reach, and a long nasty cut across
his chest bit deeply.
<p />
[Quogh--439 (4 spite) / urook - 263 (0 spite) / archer missed L4SR vs STR70 / Vin--223 (6 spite) / urook--301 (16 spite)]
<p />
Vin realized he was in trouble--this urook was tougher than he’d hoped. But it had made a mistake getting in close. Vin made a
desperate grab and managed to grab the urook. The scimitar cut him as he wrapped his arms around his enemy, but that would be the last
thing it would be doing. Vin could feel the bones breaking as he sqeezed. Quog found himself nearly on top of the last urook as it
valiantly drew its scimitar. It didn’t matter against the mighty southern troll--two blows, two dead urooks.
<p />
[Quogh--435 (2 spite) /
urook - 248 (4 spite) / Vin makes L15SRvs DEX, so--195 (0 spite) / urook--181 (1 spite, plus 12 "spite" from the scimitar)]
<p />
"Quogh! This one’s not quite dead yet. Do we want him alive?"

<em>The urooks were MR350/CON175 foes. The last one is at 154CON and Vin will do 17 per round alone. Add in help from Quogh and it's
squish-ville.
<p />
Quogh is at 28 of 121 CON.<br />
Vin is at 31 of 140 CON.<br />
Dehk is at -61 CON. (quite dead)</em>

<p />
[Editorc's note: To find out what happened to Dehk after he died, read <a href="dehksaga.html">Dehk's Saga</a>!]
<p />

<em>
Several questions to help turn this over to Khenn:
<ol>
   <li>What should the trolls do with Dekh’s corpse? Bear in mind they are unaware of his trip into the Abyss.</li>
   <li>Should the final urook be spared?</li>
   <li>Hole up and regenerate of delve onwards?</li>
</ol>
</em>

[Editorc's note: This was the last scene penned for this adventure.  Hopefully the adventure will be continued or at least
wrapped up some day.]
