"There is nothing on this side of the water, but bare stone and the passage we came in by," said Dekh. 
<p />
"So you think there is something on the other side," said Quogh.
<p />
"Yes, but I’m not swimming across with the water full of piranhas," said Dekh.
<p />
"We could throw you across," said Vin.  "I’m told that ogres have a sport called dwarf tossing.  I’m inventing goblin tossing."
<p />
"Please don’t," said Dekh.  "If you don’t throw me far enough, I land in the water and the piranhas eat me.  If you do throw me far
enough, hitting the stone floor on the other side might kill me.  No goblin tossing!"
<p />
"Aw," said Vin.
<p />
"Dang!" said Quogh.  It had seemed like a good idea to him.
<p />
"Those other trolls just jumped in," said Vin.  "We could do that, too.  Piranhas can’t hurt us."
<p />
"But I can’t swim," said Quogh.  "I sink like a stone."
<p />
"Me too," said Vin.  "But all we have to do is hold our breath and walk out of the water on the other side."
<p />
"What if we can’t get out on the other side?  How long can you hold your breath, Vin?"
<p />
"Four years, twenty-seven days, 14 hours, 38 minutes, and 10 seconds, approximately," Vin answered.
<p />
"We have to turn back," said Quogh.  There’s really nothing else that we can do."
<p />
Reluctantly, the other two agreed with him.  They went back.
<p />
After a while they found themselves in the large room again.  Dekh cast another Oh There It Is spell, and all the secret passages lit
up in purple radiance.

<p />
"Which way to go now?" said Quogh.
