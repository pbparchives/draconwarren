<p />
The giant leaped to his feet with a display of strength and agility no one would expect from a 50-foot tall giant, but Quogh was
already in full retreat.  He heard a chain whistle through the air behind him, but it missed.  He crashed through the door in the wall
and practically trampled Dekh as they all rushed upstairs.
<p />
The giant was too big to get through the door.  They all escaped.  Dekh was wishing he had learned some offensive spells.  A couple of
Take That You Fiend spells might have turned the tide in this encounter.
<p />
They climbed to the top and found themselves in the room at the end of the long corridor again.
<p />
"What now?" asked Vin.  "I don’t think I want to go back down there right now.  Lucky that giant was too big to crowd into this
stairway."
<p />
"We have a lot of options here," said Dekh.  "One thing I can tell you is that we need to stop being so trusting.  Just because we can
talk to the monsters in here doesn’t mean we should.  This is enemy territory."
<p />
"Gotta admit that your Knock Knock spell is useful, Dekh.  So is the Oh-There-It-Is and the Lock Tight," said Quogh.  "What other
magic do you have?"
<p />
Dekh grinned weakly.  "I can cast That’s a Natty Beard," he told them.  "Also Find Object, and Find Person.  The trouble is that we
haven’t really lost any objects or people, so it’s a bit hard to find them."
<p />
They rested for a while and discussed their options.

Did they:
<ol>
   <li>Go back down the hall toward the dungeon entrance?</li>
   <li>Go through door 1 down a long hall to the moat room?</li>
   <li>Go through the visible door in the wall that they haven’t tried yet?  (leads to room E).</li>
   <li>Go through secret panel number 2?</li>
   <li>Go through secret panel number 3?</li>
   <li>Go back down the long stairway and kick that giant’s butt?</li>
