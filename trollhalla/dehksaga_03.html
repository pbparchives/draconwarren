Dekh hadn't realized how hungry he was. He'd been walking non-stop for hours. There was a foul-looking mist creeping up from the main
path--the weird moonlight gave it a sickly yellowish color--and a memory was suddenly clear. He'd died. They had passed over checking
out that door, and the urooks came on them from behind.
<p />
As he approached the crude door, the smell of food became almost intoxicating. He had not noticed his hunger before, and he'd been
walking for hours, maybe days. The door was indeed a beast-hide--scaled, with a red and black geometric pattern--it looked to be some
sort of snake or lizard. He pushed the skin to one side, ducked slightly, and entered the cave.
<p />
Dehk could smell her before spotted her, and a second hunger rose in his belly. Her scent was every bit as strong as that of the elf,
which was roasting over a central fire-pit. The female goblin was crouched on the other side of the fire pit, gnawing on what looked
to be a juicy forearm. There was a spear set against the far wall. Dekh could probably get to her before she got to it. But there was
also that roast elf... and likely drink somewhere too.
<p />
She hissed at him. "This is my place! Why have you come?"
<p />
"I smelled your roasting elf--realized I couldn't remember when I last ate." Dehk replied warily. "I'm not here to take anything, but
it does look like you have more than enough to share." He wasn't sure if he liked the way she looked him over, but... she tossed a
stoppered gourd at his feet.
<p />
"It's just water. Take meat if you want it. Anything else... I'll consider later. I'm called Agunk'hla. I don't think I've ever seen
another Goblin. Not here anyway."
<p />
Dehk sliced off some elf. It was almost perfectly roasted--crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside--but there was something...
missing. He looked at Agunk'hla. Everything he liked, she had. Parts of him liked that, but like the food, there was something not
quite right. "What is this place?" he asked. "It looks like you've been here longer than I have."
<p />
"I call it the endless cavern. I remember waking up in this cave. There are delvers in the tunnels--but they usually aren't much of a
challenge. I've never found a way out though. Maybe if you stayed, we might have better luck."

[Editorc's note: This was the last scene penned in Dehk's Saga.  Hopefully the adventure will be continued or at least
wrapped up some day.]
