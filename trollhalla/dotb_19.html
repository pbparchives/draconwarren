"We can take them," said Quogh.  "Here, Vin, take this club I made."  He handed Vin a leopard leg club.
<p />
"But what’s the point?" said Dekh.  "Those birds look tough, and we’ll just get all banged up and have to rest even longer.  Anyway, I
have our next meal.  Back to the Dungeon of the Bear."  He skipped through the doorway and said, "Come on, quick!"
<p />
Vin went through, and then Quogh just as an ear-splitting skreek filled the air.  Quogh slammed the door in a vulture’s face and felt
a satisfying thump as the mghty bird was knocked back on his tail-feathers.  Dekh swiftly cast a Lock Tight spell on the door, and was
rewarded by seeing it rattling and shaking, but not opening.
<p />
"Onward," said Dekh.  He handed each of the trolls a dead rabbit the size of large dog, and still had one left over for himself.  "If
you get hungry, much on this," he told them.  Vin immediately began to munch.
<p />
"Trollgod still wants a golden bear," said Quogh.  "Let’s move on."
<p />
They ambled onward through the crepuscular darkness.  After a while they came to a large square room that seemed to be the end of the
trail.  One glowing yellow brick cast a pale yellow radiance through the chamber.  In one corner was a standard dungeon door--5 feet
wide and 10 feet high--a tight fit for the trolls, but plenty of room for the goblin.
<p />
Dekh went up and listened at the door.  Dead silence.  Probably not anything waiting behind it.  Vin finished eating his rabbit.  Both
of the trolls further regenerated.  (Vin’s CON = 84; Quogh’s CON = 72)  The door opened outwards toward them.
<p />
"This is a mighty big empty room to be having just one little door in a corner," speculated Vin.
<p />
"You might be right," said Dekh.  "Shall I cast the door-finding spell?"

What should they do?
<ol>
   <li>Search for secret doors with Oh There It is?</li>
   <li>Open and enter the one door they have?</li>
   <li>Turn back?</li>
   <li>Rest until fully recovered?  (big empty room--no defensible position unless they just want to wait in a corner).</li>
