Quoghmyre looked around in dismay.  One fled, one dead, one down, and
 demons all around--this is not the way he thought the combat would
 go.
 <p />
"Come, brothers," rasped the demon he had wounded.  "This one is
 tougher than usual.  Let’s see how he does against all of us."
 <p />
Quogh had no intention of fighting all four of them.  He lunged at
 the one that was taunting him, and that one jumped back.  Then he
 hurled his boulders at two others--a nice trick he had had practiced,
 throwing with either hand.  [Lvl 4 saving roll on Dex to hit the demons
 with thrown boulders, rolled a 5 and a 4, missed both of them.  L2SR on
 SPD to dodge the 4th demon while gathering up Dekh..  Rolled a
 9--made it exactly.]
 <p />
The demons dodged the boulders thrown at them, and laughed demonic
 laughs, but Quogh used the respite to quickly gather up the fallen
 goblin, and turn to sprint away from the tower.  Howling angrily, the
 demons started in pursuit, but . . .
 <p />
About 100 feet away from the tower, they stopped as if they had hit
 an invisible wall.  There they made such a howling and gnashing of
 teeth.  It  would have been comical if Quogh’s own situation hadn’t been
 so serious.
 <p />
Vin Ahr Vin was standing by the dungeon door entrance when Quoghmyre
 arrived.  "Where’s Middleclaw?" he asked.  
 <p />
"Dead!  A demon ripped his head off," snarled Quogh.
<p />
"It looks like Dekh is dead, too."
<p />
"I don’t think so.  The blood is still flowing."
<p />
"Then maybe we can save him," said Vin.  "I remember the first thing
 you’re supposed to do is stop the bleeding."
 <p />
"Do we have any bandages?"
<p />
"Maybe Dekh brought a first aid kit."  Vin looked into Dekh’s pack.
  "Hmm, flint, steel, tinder, a canteen that goes slosh.  Rope, a
 dagger, some extra cloth, a little bottle that says "Drink me".  Vin took
 the bottle, opened it, pried Dekh’s mouth open, and poured the
 contents down his throat.  Dekh started coughing.  
 <p />
"What can we use for bandages?" Quogh asked.  
<p />
"We need cloth.  The only cloth around here is the leather of Dekh’s
 pack."  (Editor's Note: Obviously, they'd already forgotten about the extra cloth in Dehk's pack!)
 <p />
"How bout mud?" asked Quogh.  
"Yes, mud could work," Vin agreed.  They looked around.  On the shady
 side of the hill, they found a puddle left over from a recent rain
 and dug into it to obtain mud.  They plastered the sticky stuff on
 every bleeding part of Dekh’s body.
 <p />
As Vin slapped the last patch on, Dekh opened his eyes.  "What
 happened?" he croaked.  "Did we beat them?"
 <p />
"We ran away," said Vin glumly.  "Middleclaw didn’t make it, and you
 almost died."
 <p />
"Oh," said the goblin.  "There’s a healing potion in my pack . . ."
<p />
"I poured it down your throat already.  That’s probably why you’re
 still alive."
 <p />
"Oh," said Dekh.  "I’m glad I brought it then. "
<p />
Quogh looked around and found a couple more boulders.
<p />
The sun went down.  They ate all the provisions Dekh had brought
 along.  What was meant to last a goblin for at least 3 days made a scanty
 meal for two hungry trolls.
 <p />
"I feel better," said Dekh when the moon came up.  "I could go on
 now." [Dekh has regenerated back up to half his CON and is at 28 CON.
  Quogh’s 6 hits have healed.]
  <p />
"What do we do now?" asked Quogh.
<p />
"We’re going to be the laughing stock of Trollhalla if we don’t even
 get inside the Dungeon of the Bear," said Dekh.  "I think we should
 go on."
 <p />
"We’re being slaughtered out here," said Vin.  "I think we should go
 back if we can."
 <p />
"I wanna try the dungeon door," said Quogh.

What do they do?
<p />
1.	Pray to Trollgod for help or return to Trollhalla?<br />
2.	Open the door and enter the Dungeon of the Bear?<br />
3.	Run off and assume other names in some other faraway part of
 Trollworld?
