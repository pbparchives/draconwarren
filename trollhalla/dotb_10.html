Having eaten as many fish as they wanted (burrrp!) and discovered that there was nothing else worth taking from the
entrance pool, the three adventurers decided to advance along the passage way that Dekh had said was the shortest.
The corridor was 20 feet wide, and they decided to advance side by side, with Quogh on the right and Vin on the left
and Dekh in the middle.  Having already sprung one trap, they were ultra-cautious about springing more, and examined
each step closely.  The trolls looked for secret doors or panels in the walls, while Dekh checked for floor traps in
front of them.  Thus, they moved at a snail’s pace without discovering anything of note.  Walls were walls, floor was
floor.  After 90 feet, the corridor turned to the right at a 45 degree angle, and narrowed, to only 10 feet in width,
but they maintained the same search pattern.
<p />
When the corridor turned, Quoghmyre had a chance to discover a secret door on his side of the hall.  (Level 10 SR on
Luck, rolled a 5, 1 and made it.)  "There’s some kind of secret passage here," he told his companions.  They all came
to look, and felt the slight crack in the wall that was his only clue.  Then they listened intently, but heard nary a
sound.  They spent at least half an hour pushing, probing, and prodding all nearby surfaces, but nothing would open
the door.  At last they left it and walked onward.
<p />
Thirty feet later the corridor widened and turned right again at a 45 degree angle.  And after another 30 feet of
travel, they found themselves in front of a set of double doors much like the ones at the entrance,  except that these
doors had a more intricate latching system.  They appeared to be made of stone and quite heavy, and probably opened
inward as there was no handle on their side of the door.  There was however a latch that could be grasped and
depressed.
<p />
"We could have made that walk in 5 minutes," said Dekh, "but better safe than sorry.  Here we are at another set of
doors, and these have a faint bass relief of what could be a bear as carved by a drunken dwarf working with an old
spoon."
<p />
"Doors are meant to be opened," said Quogh.
<p />
"This would be the perfect place to spring another trap on us," said Vin.  "That last corner was kind of funny.  Why
not just make a 90 degree turn instead of two 45 degree turns?  And that secret door we couldn’t open makes me
nervous."
<p />
"Good points," said Dekh.  "I agree.  It’s almost certainly a trap of some sort.  The question is, do we care?  Surely
we can handle any traps this dungeon has in store for us.."
<p />
(At this point is is worth mentioning that Dekh knows Knock Knock, Lock Tight, and Oh There It Is spells.)

Should they:
<p />
1. Try the latch to open the doors?<br />
2. Use Knock Knock to open the doors?<br />
3. Turn back and go the other way?
