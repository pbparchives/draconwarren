"We have choices," said Dekh.
<p />
"That one," said Quogh pointing at the glowing spot on a wall.
<p />
"That one," said Vin pointing at the glowing spot on the floor.
<p />
They both looked at Dekh expectantly.  He realized that it was his choice.  "The one on the floor goes down, I bet," he told them.  "I
think we’re in deep enough right now. "
<p />
He gestured magically and cried "Knock, Knock!" in goblin.   The wall opened as if a panel had slid aside. 
<p />
They found a long dark passageway leading off into the rock.  "Nothing ventured, nothing lost," said Vin cheerfully.  He started down
the corridor.  It was barely big enough for the trolls to squeeze into it.
<p />
It ran for more than 1000 feet before coming to an end.  Groping about in pitch darkness as he slowly walked along, Vin’s mighty paw
finally bumped into a wall in front of him. 
<p />
They had walked for so long that they had each regenerated more of their lost constitutions.
<p />
However it wasn’t a dead end.  The corridor turned to the right and continued onward for another 500 feet before opening up into a
large gray room that was dim, but not lightless.
<p />
"I smell water," said Dekh.
<p />
<em>Zgggrr   zgggrrrr    zzgggrrrr!</em>
<p />
"What’s that sound," said Vin.
<p />
"Sounds kinda like your snoring did," answered Quogh.
<p />
"Be vewy vewy quiet," said Dekh in a whisper.  He pointed off to the side where two huge lumps filled a good part of the empty room.
"Something is sleeping there."
<p />
"Tiptoe up and take a good look," said Vin.  "We’ll get ready to fight in case you get in trouble.’
<p />
Dekh moved as silently as he could toward the two lumps.  As he came closer he saw that they were two trolls, but what monsters!  They
were easily twice as big as Quogh.  And they had clothng and weapons.
<p />
He edged back to his friends at the doorway and whispered, "Two huge well-armed trolls are sleeping there.  What are we going to do?"

Possibilities:
<ol>
   <li>Turn around and go back the way they came?</li>
   <li>Try to sneak through the room without waking them up?</li>
   <li>Wake them up and try to talk to them or befriend them?</li>
   <li>Attack them in their sleep?</li>
   <li>Run madly through the room and hope they get across and out before the two trolls can wake up and do anything to them?</li>
   <li>Other ideas?</li>
