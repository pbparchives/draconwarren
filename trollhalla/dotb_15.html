"Close the door, and leave Quogh out there to those beasts?" asked Dekh.
<p />
"Look how they’re moving together.  I think they’ve figured out a way for both to attack at once," said Vin.
<p />
Indeed the leopards began to move together until they stood flank to flank, glaring at the two humanoids in the doorway.  Then with
their bellies low to the ground, they began to slink forward.
<p />
"I could throw my boulder," said Vin.  "If I hurt one, we could rush them."
<p />
"And what if you missed?" asked Dekh.  "No.  I like your first idea much better.  Let’s close the door.  You have the long arms, reach
out and grab that handle."
<p />
Vin had to take a half step forward to reach the handle.  The leopards’ snarling rose in intensity and their muscles tensed for a rush. 
<p />
"Go, go, go!" howled Dekh.  Vin exerted all his mighty strength to pull the massive wooden door shut.  The leopards sprang.
<p />
Their impact against the wood slammed it shut in the faces of the troll and goblin.  They heard the doorlatch click.  And a muffled
cacophony of snarling and growling and what sounded like daggers ripping through wood penetrated the wall.
<p />
"Whew!" said Dekh.  "What have we let ourselves in for?  I had no idea this encounter would be so savage, so life and death every time
we make a move."
<p />
"I don’t feel so good," said Vin, sitting down abruptly.  Indeed, the troll looked like something that had crawled out of an
avalanche.  Lava-like blood still oozed from a dozen deep wounds.  The scratches on his arms and legs were the worst--bone glittered
through them in several places.
<p />
"Are you alright?" asked Dekh.  "Wounds like that would kill a man or a goblin, but I had heard that trolls were tougher."
<p />
"We are," said Vin.  "I simply need to rest, and I will recover.  Do you think it is safe to sleep here?"
<p />
For the first time Dekh looked around the "room" they had entered.  They stood upon a wide lintel of stone with the door directly in
front of them.  Walls stretched to right and left in front of them as far as the eye could see, not too far in the heavy twilight of
the dungeon, but....
<p />
Twenty feet behind them a hillside began, and climbed up into the distance.  It was half-covered with snow and a lot of scrubby plants
unlike anything they had ever seen covered the ground.  There was soil, and thin pine evergreen trees with heavy green needles
reaching up toward not a ceiling, but a sky.  Stars glittered overhead.  A cool gust of wind came down the mountainside.  Off to one
side, out of sight, but not out of hearing, a stream gurgled and splashed by.
<p />
"I don’t think we’re on Trollworld any more," said Dekh.  "There are stories of gates to other worlds, other universes . . ."
<p />
"ZZZZZZZZZ!!!!"  said Vin.  The troll had passed out, or perhaps just gone to sleep.  It seemed to Dekh he could almost see the wounds
closing.
<p />
"Yeah, you get some rest," said Dekh.  "I’m going to look around a bit."

<em>
The leopards are locked outside.  Vin needs rest.  Dekh is looking around.  How long should they rest and heal?  Should Dekh leave Vin
by himself and do some rudimentary exploration of the nearby hillside?  It’s dark.  Although he can see fairly well at close range, he
can’t look off into the distance anywhere.  Or should he try to reopen the door a little bit and monitor the behavior of the leopards?
What would you do in this situation?
<p />
Corencio helped me out by sending out DotB part 15 last night, but it's still an official posting.  I didn't have numbered choices,
but gave you all more of an opportunity for freeform expression of what you'd have Dekh do in that situation.  I still expect you to
respond, especially if you want your tvp for turn 15.
