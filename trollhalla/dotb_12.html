"This door is too small for me,’ said Quogh.
<p />
"Me too," said Vin.  "Let’s go on."
<p />
They walked on.  The further they got from the entrance with its two glowing stones, the dimmer the light became.  The
tunneld tilted to the right at a 45 degree angle for about 30 feet then straightened out again.  They then noticed a
door on the left hand side of the wall.
<p />
It was a standard dungeon door, ten feet wide, ten feet high.  It had a latch on the handle and the door obviously
opened outward.  The three adventurers roamed over to examine it.
<p />
"No magic on this door," said Dekh.
<p />
"No sign either," said Vin.  He put his hand on the latch.  It gave slightly.  "Doesn’t seem to be locked either."
<p />
Quogh put his head up against the stone and listened.  "I hear some noises, but I can’t really tell what’s making
them," he said.
<p />
Vin put his face up against the crack of the door.  "I smell something," he said, "but I can’t tell what it is.
Something alive, I think."
<p />
"Shall we open it and see what’s inside?" said Dekh.

Did they:
<p />
1. Cautiously open the door?<br />
2. Leave it shut and walk on down the darkening corridor?<br />
3. Turn back?
