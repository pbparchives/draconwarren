15:35:13	Tunnelwars is not underway yet. Trollgod needs to make up 20 more treasures and organize the character pages of contestants. I need to update them whenever something happens to the players. Very sorry. April or May is looking more likely. Anyone want to do another dungeon adventure. Maybe we could send Khayd'haik to his doom.

16:04:42	There, I did the map. I'm the second one, wow, go me. Hey, speaking of me participating before everyone else, I'll go along with Khenn's suggestion of running another text adventure while Tunnelwars gets set up. Khayd'haik can be the star of that one, sure, sounds good to me.

Everyone nominated will get an extra 1000 tvp for being active enough to garner some support. Skaat, Vin Ahr Vin, Khayd'haik, Middleclaw, Taran, K'jherrr, Dekhurrrsio, Dandelion, H'aarrrghi, Eee-Gore, Boozer, Shippy, Tosatt, Quoghmyre, Angikat, Ramsen, Grrraall, Davparrr, Naharaht, Gnarrr'l, Rrraff and Snowberrry

05:33:12	Welcome to SilverHorn! Where are you living in Baton Rouge? I was hatched and grew up there (Broadmoor subdivision), and lived my first two years as a newlywed orc with Mrs. Dracon for a couple years, but haven't lived there since '97. My folks, bro, sis, and all my formerly New Orleans-located relatives (grampa, uncles & aunts & fam) are all there now. My grampa's house was in Lakeview and was soaked up to the 2nd floor.

Anyway, I never hit the public gaming scene in Baton Rouge but it is where I got my early roots in D&D and Gamma World. There used to be this great gaming shop called LittleWars, I wonder if they're still in the phone book.

Great pic Quog! It'll make the orchive next update.

22:36:14	Heh, and here I was thinking that three trolls who don't mind walking around naked and picking up boulders would not be intimidated by a demon with riddles, and attack him right out. Apparently I was almost alone in this opinion.

Sorry to be M.I.A., at least from the perspective of not updating the Orchive of the current game. I'm collecting but I probably won't get to update the page for a couple of weeks--next week the Dracon clan is clamboring up the east coast to visit our troll friends so I'll be M.I.A. again for another week plus. Keep posting the vote results here Khenn and I'll add them to the orchive!

Happy Spring Break everyone...

Khenn Arrth said... " I'm proud of you Trollhallans. It seems that most of you are learning moderation, and how ye old GM thinks. The vote was 22 to 2 in favor of letting the demon say his piece."

Or we knew a riddle was coming.

19:03:46	yes, anyone giving hints gets major demerits. The voting is over. The puzzle solving is over. I remember now why I always thought my own dungeon writing superior to Mike and Liz's work. They always got too intellectual/clever with their writing. I'm redoing the rest of the tower on the fly. Most of you got the answer to this right, and those of you who missed it, were probably thinking too hard. I gave a lot of leeway with the answer, which is basically to just take a stretch of rope and make it into a circle. Rrraff did it best and first by saying splice the rope together so it has no ends. Splicing might be a little tricky for our heroes, but Dekh will rise to the occasion.

20:08:03	How did we know that the party had a piece of rope? We didn't. I was thinking that since it didn't matter what the party had, then it must be something that a naked troll could have. Naked trolls don't have rope.

I was thinking that maybe the answer was something like tracing out the letters 'op' in the dirt. That would be 'rope', but without the ends. But that answer just didn't feel right. But it now seems better to me than the intended answer.

I do have a hard time believing that Dekh will be able to splice a rope together in a circle. And tying two ends together will not result in a rope with no ends--they'll still be hanging out there.

So, yeah, I thought about it too hard. I hate riddles. You never know if the riddler is trying to make a play on words, or if the answer is just the obvious thing, like tying two ends of a piece of rope together.

So the riddle he did beat
