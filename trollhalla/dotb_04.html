"I can show you a rope without any ends," said Dekhurrrsio.  He
 opened his pack, took out his coil of silk rope, cut off a 4 foot length,
 tied the ends together to make one continuous loop, and neatly
 trimmed the loose ends off so that they didn’t show.  Then he held it out,
 opened it up into a rough circle, and delaimed proudly, "Behold an
 endless rope!"
<p />
The demon looked at the goblin with his rope trick and its red face
 assumed an expression of hellish fury.  "That’s right," it snarled.
  "You know, I must have seen that trick performed at least one thousand times,
 but it’s all how you interpret things, isn’t it?
<p />
With that, the demon snatched the rope from Dekh’s hands and threw it
 down on the ground.  "But even this rope does have ends," laughed
 the demon.  "Look!  The rope ends and the ground begins when you look
 at it.  It ends on the outside and the inside.  You lose!  Now, either
 go away, or face my fury!"
<p />
"That’s not fair!" protested the goblin.  
<p />
"Fair!" howled the demon.  "You call being bound in this eroding pile
 of stone for 100 years with only a stupid riddle like that to think
 about fair?  Come on!  Fight or flee!  I want some action!"  The
 flames that danced in its eyesockets where eyes should have been danced
 with incandescent glee.  Its black talons grew four inches longer, and
 an aura of flame seemed to dance off its body.
<p />
It stepped out of the doorway and reached out to seize Dekhurrrsio.
  Another demon appeared right behind it--this one heading for Vin.  A
 third followed and headed for Middeclaw.  A fourth, bigger than the
 other three combined, appeared and reached for Quoghmyre.  All four of
 the demons began to cackle hideously as they reached for their mortal
 victims.

Ok, I bet you didn’t expect that.  You have about 2 seconds to
 decide.  Fight?  Or Flee?
