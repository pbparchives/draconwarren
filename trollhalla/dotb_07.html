"We’re going in," snarled Quoghmire.  "We should have done this from
 the beginning."  He grabbed the lever and pulled it down.  There was
 a loud click and one door swung open.  
 <p />
"That was pretty easy," said Dekh.  "Even getting into Trollstone
 Caverns is harder than that."  
 <p />
Vin pulled the other door open.  They looked into the Dungeon of the
 Bear for the first time.  They saw a wide even ramp leading down at a
 fairly steep angle into the darkness.  There was no railing, and no
 walls on either side once you passed the doorway in the mountainside.
  It was dark in there--not too dark for trolls and goblins to see,
 but too dark to make out any details.
 <p />
"We need a marching order," said Dekh.  "Even this 20 foot wide ramp
 isn’t wide enough for the three of us to walk comfortably side by
 side."
 <p />
"I’ll go first," said Quogh.  He hefted a 50 pound boulder in each
 huge hand. (10d6).  "Dekh second.  Vin, you guard the rear!"
 <p />
Nobody had any problems with that arrangement.  They started down.  
<p />
CLICK!  The floor sank down an inch or two beneath Quogh’s ponderous
 tread.
 <p />
"Trap!" said Dekh.  "Everyone be ready."  They heard a sliding
 scraping noise, and then an ominous rumbling.  "What is it?" shouted Vin.
 <p />
Quogh saw it first--a huge ball of stone moving up the ramp at him
 like a charging mammoth.  Dekh and Vin saw it an instant later.  It was
 coming fast.
 <p />
There was no time for a discussion.  They had to act fast or be
 flattened.

Did they: (1) Dodge to the side?<br />
               (2) Have the two mighty trolls brace themselves and
       try to stop it?<br />
   (3) Spin and run for the exit?
