"You know, I could probably open these doors by magic," said Dekhurrrsio.  "If it is a trap, perhaps it will turn
against the trapper."
<p />
"Alright, do it," said Quoghmyre.  "I’m ready for battle if anything jumps out at us."
<p />
"Yeah," said Vin.
<p />
The goblin went up and put his ears against the doors, listening to them.  They didn’t say anything,  Then he put his
hands on them, and channeled his thoughts to cast a spell.  "kark-kark," he said. (Knock Knock in Goblin. -1 to his
WIZ.)
<p />
The doors swung slowly open, and nothing bad happened.  Inside was a hallway 30 feet wide and 30 feet high  There were
two glowing golden bricks set into the wall on either side of the door on the inside, and they gave just enough light
to show that the corridor made another 45 degree turn about 50 feet in front of them.  The walls were decoreated with
bass relief carvings of bears in many different poses.
<p />
And 20 feet down on the right hand side of the hall was a door.  It was a standard door, indeed a bit small for the
two trolls as it was only 10 feet wide and 7 feet high, and it was shut.  A piece of parchment had been tacked onto
the wood of the door, and the runes on it spelled out a simple message.  "Keep out or Be sorry." 
<p />
They gathered in front of the door while Dekh read the message. 
<p />
"Shall we go in," said Dekh.  "The door is locked, magically locked, but I think a Knock Knock spell would open it.
<p />
"If it was a simple trap," said Vin, "the sign would say "Come on in!"
<p />
"Reverse psychology," said Dekh.  "By telling us not to go in, it really dares us to do so, and thus lures us to our doom."
<p />
"Huh," said Quogh.  "If we go in there, it could be a tight squeeze and hard to get back out."

The question is:
<p />
1. Do they open the small door and enter?<br />
2. Do they ignore this door and keep on down the main passage?<br />
3. Do they do something else?  If so, what?
