Dekh wasn't completely sure that something bad wasn't going to happen. He had picked up that "bad feeling" from the door. Not
exactly that, but he knew this was definitely some old, self-sustaining magic at work. With both trolls "safely" on the other side,
he didn't feel he had a better option. Taking a deep breath, he plunged through the field.
<p />
BZZZZZTTT Dekh felt a slight burning sensation behind his left eye. "Well, it may have tickled, but that just drained away at my
Kremm. Probably yours as well--you're just too magically inept to have noticed. I will take you up on the offer for the helm,
though Vin. Nothing better than a little protection--except maybe a LOT of protection!"
<p />
Vin tossed the helmet to Dekh. A cursory examination revealed no runic inscriptions, no poisoned needles on the inside; just a
surprisingly well-made steel helmet. It was a scary-looking faceplate though--wild eyes, a rather long and down-turned nose and a
wide mouth with two protruding tusks. It settled comfortably on his head. It also sipped comfortably OFF his head. "Whew!" Dekh
exhaled heavily--he hadn't realized that he'd been holding his breath. "At least it doesn't seem to be cursed--figure I owe
you say, ten gold from my share once we get out of here, good?"
<p />
"C'mon--let's see where this goes." Quogh said. "A dimly lit passage has to be important, right? Dekh followed, but not too
closely. Vin brought up the rear. They did pause briefly at the door, some thirty feet down the corridor. Dekh listened, quickly
checked the handle--locked--and hearing nothing, "Probably not important. Let's keep going."
<p />
They proceeded down the corridor another seventy feet or so. As they turned the corner to the left, the corridor continued for another
twenty-five feet or so, then turned to the right. There was obviously a well-lit area down the next section, so Quogh stopped for a
quick look. The big troll leaned around the corner of the wall.
<p />
"There's an altar about 40 feet down the end of the way, in like an alcove, with a big golden sheep on it. There's a couple glowing
balls of light to either side. No guards, or priests, or nothing."

<em>
Is Vin OK with the 10GP offer? Y/N
<p />
What shall the delvers do?
<ol>
   <li>Continue up the corridor towards the altar?</li>
   <li>Go down the corridor back to the locked door?</li>
   <li>Go down the corridor back to the magical door?</li>
   <li>Something else?</li>
</ol>
(Quog will continue to lead unless 50% vote otherwise.)
<p />
(You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice; an example for this turn might be... "Option #1--Have Dekh
crawl like a cowardly worm up towards the altar.")
