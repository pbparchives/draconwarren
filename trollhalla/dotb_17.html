The troll sat up and looked around.   Not far away he saw his 50 pound weapon, a bloody boulder that had rolled up against the wall
near the door.
<p />
The big white leopard managed to roll onto its stomach, and seemed to be trying to get its feet beneath it.  Even battered and broken,
it was a magnificent beast.
<p />
"Too bad I can’t tame it," thought Quogh.  "What a hunting partner it would make!"
<p />
The leopard snarled.
<p />
"Naaaa, bad idea," Quogh muttered to himself.  He staggered to his feet and headed over toward the boulder.
<p />
The leopard came to its feet, not an easy task as one front leg was clearly broken, and limped toward him.
<p />
Quogh got the huge stone in his huge hand, turned, and lurched/fell toward the animal.  He put everything he had into one mighty blow
at the leopard’s head, and the beast was too hurt to dodge it.  The stone connected.  The skull split and the boulder cracked in
half.
<p />
Smashed back to the hard stone floor, there was no doubt that the mighty snow leopard was dead this time.
<p />
"Hunnh hunnnh hunnnh!" Quogh gasped.  "That was hard.  I need food."
<p />
Great stone trolls like Quoghmyre can actually eat rock, but the softer forms of rock--things like coal or shale or tin.  There wasn’t
any of that kind of rock available in the Dungeon of the Bear.  But there was a huge leopard.
<p />
Quogh began to feed.  He grabbed the leopard by a leg and bit down on the paw.  The rocky ridges inside his mouth that doubled for
teeth ground up the flesh, muscle, bone, and chitin of the leopard’s foot.  He spat out the fur--as much as he could--and swallowed the
rest.  Bite by bite he worked his way up the leopard’s leg.  As he added more mass to his body, he could feel the regeneration
rebuilding him from the inside out.  It itched, but it was a powerful burning itch and actually felt good.
<p />

<p />
Vin snored--a hideous rasping noise that grated on Dekh’s eardrums.  The big troll seemed to be sleeping a bit easier now.  Dekh grew
tired of watching him, and decided to explore.  With sword in hand, he wandered toward the sound of running water.
<p />
He soon had to leave the lintel of stone behind.  The hard stony soil of the hillside felt good after all the dungeon walking.  He
crested a small ridge and saw the stream, running down a fold between two converging slopes, not more than a few inches deep.  He
approached and stuck his hand in the water.  Icy cold!  Cupping his hand, he brought some up to drink.  Clear, cold, icy, with just a
hint of mountain moss in the flavor, Dekh thought it was delicious.  Dropping to hands and knees, he put his head in the water and
gulped down a hearty draught.  It refreshed him, and woke him up completely.
<p />
Wiping the back of his arm across his dripping muzzle, Dekh looked around to see what else the mountainside had to offer.  A bit up
the hillside were some thick bushes that looked promising.  He climbed up to them, and was rewarded by finding them in bloom with
sparse black berries of some sort half the size of his fist.  He picked one and sniffed it--smelled ok.  Then he nibbled on it.  Sweet
and with a bitter aftertaste.  Then he gobbled it up.
<p />
He spent a few minutes gathering more berries and putting them in his sack.  As he moved around the bush, he discovered the hole.
Quite a large hole, big enough for him to enter at a crouch.  A kind of rotten smell--like meat gone bad--wafted out of it.  Back on
Trollworld Dekh would have guessed a hole like this to be the burrow of a rabbit or a snake, but it was ten times the size of any he
had ever seen. 
<p />
As he watched it, he heard a kind of thumping coming from under the earth.  Something lived in there, and that something could be
prey.  A gleam came into Dekh’s beady red eyes--nothing a goblin loved more than an underground hunt!
