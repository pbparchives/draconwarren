Quogh couldn’t eat the whole leopard, but he did devour more than half of it, grinding up the bones as he ate.  That’s where the real
nutrition was.  With a satisfied belch, he stood up and took stock of the situation.  His boulder was broken and useless, but he could
use the leopards hind legs as clawed clubs.  He ripped them both off the carcase and peeled the meat off the femur.  When he was
finished he had two clubs (6D6 each.)
<p />
Then he wandered over to check the door.  When he got close he could distinctly hear the sound of a buzz saw on the other side.  Or
maybe it was another monster lying in wait.  Quogh asked himself if he was ready for another fight, and the answer was: Sure, bring it
on!
<p />
He grabbed the latch and pulled the door open.  He had his clubs ready to smash anything that leapt at him, but all he found was Vin
Ahr Vin, lying on his back with his gut protruding.  The big troll looked nearly as battered as Quogh felt. 
<p />
Quogh considered poking Vin and saying, "Boo!"  If Vin thought he was dead, and why else would he have gone off and left him behind,
he should get quite a shock if he woke up abruptly at Quogh’s haunting.
<p />
Before he could make up his mind, Dekh appeared.  He was dragging the bodies of some rabbits that were almost as big as he was.
<p />
"Quogh, good to see you!  We thought you were dead," yelled Dekh. 
<p />
"I was, but I didn’t stay dead.  I wonder why the leopards didn’t eat me though."
<p />
"They tried.  You didn’t taste good to them."
<p />
"Har har har!" Quogh bellowed.  That woke Vin up.
<p />
"Huh, Wuzzup?" asked the bleary-eyed troll.
<p />
Dekh instinctively looked up and thus he saw the two giant vultures gliding in for an attack.
<p />
"Trouble," said Dekh.  He pointed up.  Quogh and Vin looked up just in time to see two huge condors with thirty-foot wingspans
spiraling down towards them.

<em>
Quogh and Vin have regenerated back up to half CON each.  What should they do:
<ol>
   <li>stay and fight the giant condors?</li>
   <li>quickly retreat back into the dungeon and close the door?</li>
   <li>run off up the mountainside?</li>
   <li>Other?</li>
</ol>
</em>

<p />

<em>If you were Quogh, what would you do in this situation?</em>
