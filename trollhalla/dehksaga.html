<h1>Dehk's Saga</h1>
<h2>The second of the Gimor's <a href="http://www.trollhalla.com"
      target="_new">Trollhalla</a> Adventures</h2>
<h4>Archive Complete (all 3 scenes), adventure was never finished (1st version)<br />
   Artwork count: 1<br />

<hr />
<strong>Orchivist's Note:</strong> This adventure barely got started before
it halted.  It has yet to be completed.  Poor Dehk the goblin died after making it through 35
scenes of <a href="dotb.html">The Dungeon of the Bear</a>, run primarily by Ken St.
Andre but taken over by Gimor Ironfang after 27 turns.  But Gimor gave Dehk
a second chance at life (or death) in the Abyss.
<p />
The <a href="index.html">Orchive</a> is proud to present the opening scenes
of the adventure which ran for three scenes in July and September of 2006.  Gimor attempted
to restart in November of 2006 but after recapping the first three moves, there was no
follow-up.  I guess Dekh is in after-death limbo!  There is a chance that I as the orchiver
missed the follow-up adventure, but I don't remember there being anything after these three
scenes.
<p />
Anyone wishing to create an artistic scene of our brave adventurers may submit it to me
and I will add it to the orchive.
