They went back.  Dekh found the hidden panels again.  After much discussion, they decided to try the downward portal.  Dekh opened it
up with a Knock Knock, and they saw a lightless stairway leading down.
<p />
They followed it.  They went down at least 300 feet.  As they moved in darkness, they began to hear a strange noise. 
<p />
Eventually they could recognize the words in the Common Tongue.  It was a deep bass voice chanting over and over: MIGHTY MIGHTY ME.
MIGHTY MIGHTY ME.  MIGHTY AS CAN BE.  LONE SOME AS A TREE.  MIGHTY MIGHTY ME!
<p />
Finally they reached the bottom and found a dead end.  An Oh there it is by Dekh found the secret panel, and a Knock Knock opened it.
<p />
Revealed beyond the wall was a vast irregular cavern.  It was lighted somehow very dimly, and they could make out distant walls, along
with some enormous stalagmites and stalactites.  About 100 feet away, and not looking at them was a huge giant, at least 50 feet tall.
It was he that was chanting, and he hadn’t noticed them yet.
