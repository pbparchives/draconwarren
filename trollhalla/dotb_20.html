"Use the spell," said Vin.  "Is it true that you turn purple every time you cast that enchantment?"
<p />
"Watch and see," answered Dekh.  He put his sword away, raised both hands mystically above his head, and spun around in a circle
waving his hands wildly up and down while shoulting "G’leth har shnookum!" (Oh There It Is in goblin).
<p />
Purple light spewed wildly from his fingertips and covered all corners of the room.  When he stopped moving, the royal radiance slowly
died away, except . . .
<p />
When the glow died away, four spots remained glowing—three on the walls and one in the floor in roughly this pattern:
<p />

3



                                                                       D
2                              4                                  1
</pre>
<p />
"Look at that!" cried Vin.  "You’re not purple, but what a show, and now we have 5 choices.
<p />
Quogh quickly moved around and dropped some torn off pieces of giant rabbit fur wherever there was a glow.  Three spots on the walls
were in corners, and the one on the floor was in the center up against the back wall.
<p />
"We have plenty of choices now," said Quogh.  They tried the usual thing, listening carefully at each location, but all they heard
anywhere was stone getting older.
<p />
"There doesn’t seem to be any way to open these doors," said Vin.  "I can’t even see a crack where they are."
<p />
"Knock knock will probably open them," said Dekh, "and I can do that spell, too."
