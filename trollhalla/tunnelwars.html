I knew I should have written it offline. I just wrote a long letter explaining trollwars and sent it without saving it first. Trollhalla had timed out on me, so I lost it. I will have to rewrite it. Look for instructions on Trollwar tomorrow. Meanwhile, I can tell you this about it. It's all about monster to monster combat in a maze of tunnels with treasures that will help you in your fights hidden throughout for tvp and glory points. I need a dozen volunteers. You only have to do one move a day. You can write contingency orders to help speed the moves along. It's a game of limited information, but the high points of the game will be posted to all members of Trollhalla. K'jherrr and Dandelion have already signed up. Sign up now for immediate tvp rewards.
