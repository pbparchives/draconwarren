As the four minions walked toward the old ruined tower, they began to
 notice some other remains in the vicinity.  From the different piles
 of rubble that came into view as they approached  there must have
 been at least two other buildings and a wall.
 <p />
"Does anyone know anything about this ruin?" asked Vin.
<p />
"I have heard something," answered Dekh.  "A hundred years ago, more
 or less, some crazy bandit lord built a castle here to keep
 adventurers from entering the dungeon, or maybe to charge a tax on any who
 entered or left.  The flaw in his plan was that the monsters who live
 down below got tired of being cut off in this fashion, and came up one
 night in force and destroyed the place.  The was also something about
 a sorceress and some demons, but I’m not sure of the details."
 <p />
"So this was a human fortress," said Quogh, "and monsters, like us,
 destroyed it? Har, har and har!  I take that as a good omen."
 <p />
"And here’s another good omen," he chortled, scooping up a 50 pound
 boulder.  "See how neatly this rock fits into my hand.  I’ve found my
 weapon."  (Boulder  = 10d6 when wielded by a troll.)  (<em>Editorc's Note:
 Looking around, he found another and palmed it with his other hand.</em>)
 <p />
"I’d rather have something with an edge to it," grumbled Middleclaw.
<p /> 
"A roofing beam for me, if we can find one," laughed Vin.
<p /> 
"It has been over a hundred years," said Dekhurrrsio.  "I doubt if
 any roofing beams survive."
<p /> 
"One tower is still standing.  Perhaps something can be found there,"
 suggested Vin.
<p /> 
They now stood in the center of the rubble.   Quogh’s face began to
 wrinkle up, and then he sneezed.  "Does anyone else smell brimstone?"
 he asked.
<p /> 
Now that he mentioned it, they all detected that infamous odor of
 rotten eggs.
<p /> 
"We’re here," said Dekhurrrsio.  "What should we do first?"

<em>
Should they investigate pile of rubble A?<br />
Pile of rubble B?<br />
The standing tower?<br />
Or split up and investigate all three?  If so, who goes where?</em>
