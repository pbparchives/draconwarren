When Vin heard the words "Fight or Flee!" he turned and sprinted for
 safety.  Thus he missed seeing the fight of trolls and one brave
 goblin versus demons.
 <p />
The doorway demon was closest to Dekhurrrsio, and so he raked at the
 goblin with his 8 inch long talons.  Dekhurrrsio only had time to
 strike out with a mighty blow to the face that knocked the demon back
 on it’s butt.  But in the next instant, the goblin’s body erupted
 into fountains of blood, as the tearing claws had ripped through him
 everywhere they touched.    With a blood-strangled cry, he fell back and
 collapsed.  [Dekh 357 with no spite: Demon 1 414 with 5 spite.  Dekh
 takes 57 hits--spite doesn’t matter.  Dekh has a CON of 55.  He goes
 down unconscious and dying with a CON of -2]
 <p />
The second demon leaped at Middleclaw.  The troll tried to defend
 himself with a flurry of blows.  It did him no good.  The demon knocked
 him down and great claws ripped his head off.  Hot, lavalike blood
 jetted from the stump on the shoulders of the troll, and the broken
 body collapsed--dead as a troll ever got.  [Middleclaw does 289]
 (<em>Editorc's note: I believe Trollgod meant to write: Middleclaw takes
 289 hits.</em>)
 <p />
The third demon raced up to attack Quoghmyre, but the largest of the
 trolls was also the most prepared.  He had picked up 2 large boulders
 and had one in each hand.  He brought them smashing around at the
 demon, and knocked it back, but not before a long black talon scored
 line down one mighty arm. 
 <p />
"Ouch!" said Quogh’s demon with a hellish smile.  "You actually
 managed to hurt me a little, but only a little.  How will you do when four
 of us turn on you, my brawny one?"
 <p />
Quoghmyre couldn’t help feeling a bit of dismay as the four demons
 spread out to surround him.  He considered leaping at the wounded one,
 and bashing it again, but if he did so, the other three would get
 free attacks on him.  It occurred to him that Vin had actually done the
 smart thing, or maybe he was just more cowardly than he had seemed.
  Middleclaw looked dead--being beheaded was usually fatal even to
 trolls.

<em>
The fight is going very badly for our trollish heroes.  Should Quogh:<br />
(1) stay and fight to the bitter end, <br />
 (2) turn and make a run for it<br />
 (3) pick up Dekh and make a run for it<br />
(4) try to talk his way out of trouble?
<p />
For extra points, was Vin’s rapid retreat smart or cowardly?
