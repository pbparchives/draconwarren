"I did some scouting while you two were napping. The door is stuck. The crack up there is a tight fit for me, and it stinks like
carrion too. As for the magical door, well, I almost touched it, and it seemed to be... hungry is the best way I can put words to it.
For what, you got me. The corridor looks to be maybe a hundred feet or so--hard to tell in this crummy Glowmoss light. There is a
door not quite halfway up on the left--looks closed from here."
<p />
Quogh looked around, picked up a not too badly burned up spider and tossed it through the magical field. "Howzit like this?" BZZZZZTTT
There was a brief, sparkly flash from the door, but the spider’s remains landed about where one would have expected, and looked no
worse for the wear.
<p />
"HAW-HAW!! Dekh, you go first again. Maybe there’s something else you can fight!" Vin laughed. "So anyway, you want to try this
helmet? I gots nowhere to carry it. And this little knife looks better than yer teensy-weensy sticker knife too."
<p />
"No bloody way. You go first, tough guy." The goblin shot back.
<p />
"I’ll do it." said Quogh, rising slowly from the floor. He took a few steps towards the doorway, stopped, and looked at Vin. "On
second though, you can go first Vin!" Quogh grabbed Vin by the arm, and with a quick pirouette, sent him hurtling down the corridor.
<p />
BZZZZZTTT There was another brief, sparkly flash from the door as Vin passed through the field. "Hey that tickles!"
<p />
"BWAH-HAH-HAH!! Now THAT was funny Vin!" Quogh said with a rumbling chuckle. "Let’s go Dekh."  BZZZZZTTT as Quogh made his way down
the passage.
<p />
Dekh wasn’t completely sure that something bad wasn’t going to happen. He had picked up that "bad feeling" from the door. Not exactly
that, but he knew this was definitely some old, self-sustaining magic at work. With both trolls "safely" on the other side, he didn’t
feel he had a better option. Taking a deep breath, he plunged through the field.
<p />
BZZZZZTTT Dekh felt a slight burning sensation behind his left eye. "Well, it may have tickled, but that just drained away at my
Kremm. Probably yours as well--you’re just too magically inept to have noticed."
<p />
Each delver has permanently lost 1 WIZ (Vin = 4 / Quogh = 4 / Dekh = 55)

Two votes this time:
<ol>
   <li>Does Dekh put on the horned helmet?<br />
   a. Yes<br />
   b. No<br /></li>
   <li>What shall the delvers do?<br />
   a. Go through the door.<br />
   b. Continue on down the corridor.<br />
   c. Go back through the doorway into the spider room.<br />
   d. Something else?<br /></li>
</ol>
(You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice; an example for this turn might be... "Option #1 – Have Vin throw Quogh through the normal door.")
