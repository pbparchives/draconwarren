Bamf!  Bamf!  Bamf!  Bamf!
<p />
Three naked trolls and a neatly-equipped goblin suddenly stood there
 on a rocky lintel in front of  two large doors set directly into the
 rocky mountain side.  Each door was 15 feet tall and ten feet wide,
 and each had the scowling countenance of a bear  carved into its stony
 surface.  In the center of each door stood an iron lever that could
 be moved from side to side.
 <p />
50 yards off to one side stood a ruined tower at the terminating
 point of an overgrown road--too wide to be a path, and rutted where wagon
 wheels had worn their way through dirt and stone, but obviously not
 well used recently.
 <p />
"This is the Dungeon of the Bear!" boomed an awesome voice.  "Once you
 enter it, you’re on your own--I cannot help you there.  I want you to
 use your considerable might and cunning to explore it and bring back
 for me at least one, and preferably two of the huge golden bear
 statues rumored to be within."
 <p />
"But I’m not supposed to be nude and weaponless," objected
 Middleclaw.  "I told you I wanted my . . ."
 <p />
"You wanted some enchanted weapon and other stuff," growled the
 invisible trollgod.  "Yes, you told me, but you didn’t put it in writing,
 as I requested, and I’ve told you many times that I’m forgetful.  You
 don’t have it."
 <p />
"Not fair," growled Middleclaw.  "Dekhurrrsio has a crossbow and all
 sorts of gear."
 <p />
"He cleared it with me at the last second," said Trollgod.  "Lucky
 for all of you that he did."
 <p />
"Har, har, and har!" guffawed Quoghmyre, the biggest of the bunch.
  "I don’t need anything but myself."
  <p />
"As for the rest of you," continued the Trollgod, "you didn’t even
 try to talk to me about what you wanted to bring on this expedition.
  So, you get nothing.  Now get in there and find those statues."
  <p />
"What about the tower?" asked Vin Ahr Vin.  "Shouldn’t we check it
 out?"
 <p />
"Do what you want," answered the Trollgod, as his voice faded away to
 a distant rumble, "but the bear statues are not inside the tower."
 <p />
"Another fine kettle of fish you’ve gotten me into," snarled
 Dekhurrrsio the rogue.   "At least we know a few spells, right?  I know a
 few, but not that many."
 <p />
"I think I can remember some," said Middleclaw, "though I wish I had
 my grimoire."
 <p />
"Let’s get started," said Vin Ahr Vin (hereafter known as Vin).
<p />
"Har, har, and har!" snorted Quoghmyre (hereafter known as Quogh).
  "Yes, let’s, but which way should we go.  There might be weapons and
 such in that old tower that we could use.  Should we check it out?"

 <em>Delvers, you missed your chance to take equipment.  This is your one
 chance to take spells.  Middleclaw, and Vin, specify what spells you
 know when you vote, or I assume you don’t know any.
<p />
Everyone
 choose--either open the door and enter or go explore the ruined tower.
 <p />
 As usual, speed counts in the voting for tvp and majority rules.  If
 you have a suggestion you’d like to make for delver action, put it in
 your vote.  You may lobby for things on Trollhalla, but you need at
 least a plurality vote to get such suggestions accepted.</em>
