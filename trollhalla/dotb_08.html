The huge stone ball rolled up the ramp like a bowling ball headed for
 a strike with our heroes as the pins.
<p />
"Dodge it!"  yelled Dekhurrrsio, throwing himself off to the side.
  The trolls were just a little slower to reach that conclusion, but
 they also threw themselves violently sideways.
<p />
[L10SR vs. DEX required to successfully dodge this massive ball.  Vin
 has a DEX of 75 only a fumble misses.  He rolls 5, 5, then 2, 2, and
 4, 6 for a total of 24.  240 a.p. for Vin.
<p />
Quogh has a DEX of 26.  He needs to roll a 39 to make it.  He rolls:
 6, 1 for a total of 7.  70 a.p. for Quogh.  The ball hits him hard.
<p />
  Dekh has a DEX of 72.  Only a fumble misses for him.  He rolls: 3, 3
 then 4, 1 for a total of 11 getting 110 a.p.]
<p />
Quogh was in the lead, and thus closest to the ball.  He tried to
 throw himself to the side, but was too slow.  The hurtling ball slammed
 into him and catapulted him off to the side.  [32 hits of damage.]
<p />
Dekh was next.  He successfully leaped out of the way.  Vin also
 jumped clear of the hurtling ball.
<p />
There were no sidewalls on the ramp.  All three went flying out into
 open space, and their leaps turned into falls.
<p />
"aaaaaaaaaaaaa!" yelled Dekh when he realized he was in free fall.
<p />
Splash!   SPLASH!  SPLASH!
<p />
They landed in a shallow pool of water.  By the time the trolls
 splashed into the pool, it was nearly empty.  Hundreds of piranhas and
 other small fish had been blown all over the surrounding area by the
 mighty impacts.
<p />
Nobody was further hurt by the fall.
<p />
Dekh stood up, dripping.  "Well, we found the quick way down," he
 said.
<p />
"And the water supply for this end of the dungeon," added Vin.
<p />
"Ow," said Quogh.  "That thing hit me!  Half my body feels like it
 has been pulverized."
<p />
"Yer not really hurt," said Vin cheerfully.  "All yer bodily parts
 are still attached."
<p />
"Over here, guys," called Dekh, as he climbed out of the pond and
 found himself in a wide hallway running off to his left and right.  Soon
 the trolls joined him.  They spotted a wide ramp off to their right
 a few feet leading upwards.
<p />
Then they heard an ominous rumbling.
<p />
"No!  not again!" shouted Quogh with alarm.
<p />
Looking at the ramp, they saw the huge ball rolling back down it.
  They prepared to dive back into the pond, but the ball simply rolled
 past them and into a huge alcove in the hallway that was directly
 opposite it.  Something caught the ball, and then before their eyes, a
 heavy stone wall slammed down, and within moments they could no longer
 detect any difference between that part of the corridor and the rest.
<p />
"I wasn’t expecting a bath," said Vin.
<p />
"That actually felt kinda good," Dekh admitted.  Goblins had much
 more affinity for water than trolls did.  "I suppose that trap acts as a
 doorknocker to let the inhabitants know they have company.  We
 should be alert and cautious from here on."
<p />
"We’ve been alert and cautious all the way so far," said Vin, "and
 what good has it done?"
<p />
"Ow," said Quogh.  "I should have let you take point, Quogh!"
<p />
They found themselves in a hallway 20 feet wide and 15 feet tall.  It
 was dark, but they could see fairly well.  Some starlight came down
 through the ramp entryway.  It was hard to make out details.  
<p />
"I had a torch in the pack," said Dekh.  "But it’s soaking wet and
 won’t light now.  We don’t need more light, do we?"
<p />
"Nawwww!" said Vin.  "I can see well enough.  What should we do now?"
  They are standing in the hallway facing the blank wall opposite the
 entry ramp.

<em>  Should they:
<p />
1. go left?<br />
2. go right?<br />
3. go back up the ramp and leave?<br />
4. search the pond and their immediate surroundings.
