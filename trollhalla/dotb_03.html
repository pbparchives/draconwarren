They walked past the piles of rubble and approached the one standing
 tower.  The closer they came, the stronger the odor of brimstone
 became.
 <p />
It turned out that the door was on the other side of the tower, and
 it was sized for normal human beings, being about 7 feet high and 3
 feet wide.
 <p />
"I don't think I can get through that little door," said Quogh.
<p />
"But we could send the goblin in," answered Vin. "Let's open it."
<p />
Middleclaw grasped the lever on the door and pulled strongly.  The
 door creaked open.  Obviously the hinges hadn't been oiled in 100
 years.
 <p />
They looked in, but it was dark, and coming from the bright outdoors,
 they couldn't make anything out.
 <p />
"Go on in, Dekh!" said Vin.
<p />
Dekhurrrsio started to step inside the door, but suddenly there was a
 being in his path.  It was a bright red being with black horns,
 tusks, and batlike wings.  It wore no clothing, and carried no weapons,
 but the sleek, muscular body conveyed a sense of great power.  It
 smelled strongly of brimstone.
 <p />
"You cannot enter here unless . . ."
<p />
"By the Trollgod, it's a demon!" shouted Middleclaw.

<p />
<em>
	What did our heroes do:<br />
	Did they (1) turn around and run away<br />
	(2) attack it and try to force their way in, or<br />
(3) talk to it?

"You cannot enter here unless . . ."
<p />
"By the Trollgod, it's a demon!" shouted Middleclaw.
<p />
"Unless what? Unless we hogtie your feet, cut off your horns and tie
 a knot in yawls tail? Come on, Sagebrush Sam, we can take him.  Har har
 and har!"  Quogh laughs to himself as he seems to making a joke that
 only he 
understands.
<p />
The others looked at Quogh in total uncomprehension.  "Let it finish
 its statement," said Dekh.
 <p />
"Say yer piece, critter," prodded Quogh.
<p />
The demon calmly repeated itself.  "You cannot enter here unless you
 show me a rope that has no end."
