Dekh cleared his throat, and turned towards the trolls. "Cobwebs mean spiders, or I’m an elven virgin. Who wants to go first?"
<p />
"He should... he’s the..."<br />
"...strongest Champion." Vin suggested, pointing a rocky finger at Quogh.<br />
"...toughest Champion." said Quogh, pointing his rocky finger at Vin.
<p />
"But the southernmost troll should have the honor."
<p />
"No, by all means, Master of TrollBridge, I leave the first spider to you."
<p />The
two trolls’ banter quickly descended into "No, you go first. No, you go first."--trollish warriors being known more for brawn rather
than brains.
<p />
Fortunately, Dekh remembered that he had a few torches in his pack. As the trolls looked to be headed towards a quick wrestling match
to decide who would get to be the second to enter the room, Dekh raked a dwarven firestick across the floor, lit up a torch, and
tossed it into the room. The cobwebs smoldered and burned. (If you’re keeping track -- Dekh has 5 torches remaining).
<p />
"Eeewww!" Quogh sniffed. "Vin, what’d you do?"
<p />
"Wasn’t me." Vin replied.
<p />
"Basic delving technique." Dekh said with a smile. "Good
thing one of us thought to bring more than just his fists."
<p />
The flaming webs created a modest amount of foul-smelling greenish smoke, and a dozen or so fist-sized spiders were scuttling out of
the room. They seemed more intent on escaping the fire than in confronting the delvers. The smoldering, pony-sized wolf spider behind
them wasn’t.
<p />
Dekh tried to get to his crossbow, but couldn’t reach it in time. (L10SR vs SPD: needed 19 rolled 11)  He was lucky enough to draw his
scimitar, just as the spider was leaping towards him. (L10SR vs LK: needed 4 rolled 7)  The spider’s leap was perfect, and Dekh found
himself on his back, with a couple hundred pounds of nasty spider on top of him. He had managed to keep the mandibles away from his
throat with his free hand, but felt something rake across his right thigh - and the blood that was gushing from the spider’s abdomen,
where the scimitar was buried hilt-deep, burned at his hand. It was ripped from his grasp when the mortally wounded spider, propelled
by two rock trolls, flew across the room and splattered against the north wall.
<p />
(Dekh: 4d6 + 4 + 360 = 372 {0 spite}; MR150 Spider -- 16d6 + 75 = 134 {5 spite}; 238 hits on the spider kills it; Dekh drops to 39
CON)
<p />
As Dekh retrieved his scimitar, Quogh checked out the room -- roughly 20ft by 30ft, with no doors other than the one he had entered
through. "There’s a lot of burned up spiders, some bones and stuff -- maybe five or six -- and what looks like what was a human-sized
table and a couple stools."

<em>
What shall the delvers do?
<ol>
   <li>Search through the spider room.</li>
   <li>Go through Secret Door #1 (SE corner - back to the room with the water)</li>
   <li>Go through Secret Door #2 (SW corner).</li>
   <li>Go through Secret Door #3 (NW corner).</li>
   <li>Go through Secret Door #4 (trap door - back to the giant)</li>
   <li>Go back down the wide corridor towards the entrance.</li>
   <li>Something else.</li>
</ol>
(You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice; an example for this turn might be... "Option #1 – Search the bones, but have Dekh cast Natty Beard on Quog.”)
