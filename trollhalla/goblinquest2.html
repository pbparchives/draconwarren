<strong>Orchivist's Note:</strong>
Here's the fourth Trollhalla Adventure story as directed by the Trollgod.
I admit, I didn't archive it myself.  Aarra'aghaa gets all the credit
for compiling this narrative.  You can read the <a
href="goblinquest2.txt">raw text version</a> I saved from the e-mails unedited.
This adventure took place over e-mail among Trollhalla members from January 10
through 20, 2007.  I didn't archive any of the Trollwalla commentary this time
so don't look for it!
<p />
And if you missed it, go read the <a href="goblinquest.html">first adventure
of Boozer!</a>
<p />
Grumpily,<br />
Taran Dracon the ORC!

[After writing this, Taran grunted, sniffed, and wandered back to
his cave, <a href="../index.html">Dracon Warren</a>.]

It's time for
another story of the brave adventurers of Trollhalla. I notice that the mightiest
of us all right now is Boozer. Therefore, I am sending him on a trip to
Khazan to take a message to the Death Goddess.<br />
<br />
As your first test, look at Boozer's
character in the Hall of Champions, and at your rulebooks, and tell me what
armor and weapons Boozer is carrying on this trip. Also, if you were
sending a message to the Death Goddess, what would it be?<br />
<br />
The Adventures of Boozer in Khazan have begun.<br />
<br />
H'aaarrrrggghhh!</p>

<p></p>

<p>*****************************</p>

<p></p>

<p>Boozer arrived at
the river gate on the eastern wall of Khazan with the sun. There were
hundreds of farmers with wagons waiting to bring their produce into the city,
but the guards saw his weapons and armor and that he wasn't human, and brought
him in through the Warrior's Gate. When he told them that he had a
message for the Death Goddess, they gave him a map to the palace and wished him
good luck, not bothering to mention that no one had seen Her Frightfulness for
years.<br />
<br />
Boozer remembered what the Trollgod
had said to him when giving him the pouch, "Be sure to do any sightseeing
that you want to do in Khazan before you go see the Death Goddess. Things
might get hairy afterwards."<br />
<br />
Boozer went to the Trollgod's armory
and outfitted himself for the journey. When finished, he looked in the
mirror and examined himself. He wore soft, ankle-high leather boots, in
dark green, with tiny axes embroidered onto them at the front, normal clothing
(woolen trousers, cotton shirt and vest!) in 'earthy' tones, including
waistcoat and hooded cloak. Adorning his waist were a broad black belt and
ornate dragon head buckle.  He carried a
backpack containing a delver’s pack, a small grapple hook and 20' of fine elven
silk rope, a few provisions for the day, flint and steel, a water skin, 3 wax
candles, a magnetic compass, a small bulls-eye lantern, and spare oil. A large,
battered drinking tankard also hung from his pack. Externally it was decorated
with a dragon pattern, and inside at the bottom are the words "drink to me
only with thine eyes". Is this tankard magical?  Not telling!<br />
<br />
His armor comprises of a buckler and
soft green leather armor.  He carried
only small weapons so as not to appear threatening (as Pacino said in
<em>Devil’s Advocate</em>, "Always be the
little guy.  They don't see ya’
coming!")  He carried a fang-wing
dagger that he can throw if desired, a sax for hand to hand fighting that is
usually hidden within his cloak, carried a very light self-bow across his back,
and usually carries a sheaf of fishbow arrows. He sometimes carries a war bola when
he is in wilderness areas or on a journey.  Although Boozer is skilled in swordcraft,
he does not yet own a sword as
he is saving up for a special one!<br />
<br />
Once inside the city, he passed by
the entrance to the Dwarven City of Thrindol, skirted the already bustling
marketplace, and spotted the high coliseum walls of the Arena. On the
southern edge of Thrindol, he saw a sign saying "Future location of
Gristlegrim: Khosht" that bore picture of a grinning, one-eyed Dwarf.<br />
<br />
As he wandered toward the palace, he
saw a magnificent building all made of green stone. Approaching it, he
learned it was the Temple
of the Money Gods. "Hmm," said Boozer. "I didn't
know that gods had money."<br />
<br />
As he wandered around the building
away from the front, he found himself by a waterfall with a pool. Through
the clear water he could see many coins lying on the bottom, only a couple of
feet down. Checking to see if anyone was looking--no one seemed to be--he
waded in and scooped up a handful of gold and silver (3 gold, 6 silver). As he tucked the money into his pouch, he felt
something strange--he was rising, levitating!<br />
<br />
"I'll give it back!"
yelled Boozer, but it was too late for that. The force that held him
propelled him through the waterfall and into a cavern of some sort.
Enough light came through the water so that he could dimly see a doorway
ahead of him and these words carved into the stone, "Go forward, thief!
To retreat now would be your doom."<br />
<br />
Boozer had seen stranger things in
his life, so he didn't panic. As his feet touched the ground, he looked
around carefully to see what his options were.<br />
<br />
The waterfall roared and pounded
behind him, seeming to be the obvious way out. Off to the right was a
pile of large round  and protruding from the
pile was the hilt of a broadsword with a finely wrought hilt. Ahead of
him was a tunnel entrance moving into darkness--not that he would have any
trouble seeing in such a place. The rest was only stone.<br />
<br />
"That's what I get for stealing
from money gods," Boozer muttered to himself. "What was I
thinking?'</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Hurmmm,"
said Boozer, "a sword in some stones. If I pull it out, maybe I'll
become the King of Khazan. Naaaaahhhh, that only works in fairy tales,
and I'm no fairy. Still, let's take a look at it."<br />
<br />
He walked over to the sword.
As he got closer he noticed that some of the rocks seemed to have a few
chips and scratches on them, and the sword looked better and better. He
also felt a kind of tingle in the back of his mind, but whether it was a good
tingle or a bad tingle, he couldn't tell.<br />
<br />
He stretched
out his hand and pulled the sword from the stone. As it came free it rang
like a bell and began to glow with a white light.<br />
<br />
Just then the rock pile began to
pull itself into a vaguely humanoid form. Even as the legs formed, it lunged
at Boozer.<br />
<br />
The sword seemed to know what to do,
as it pulled Boozer's arm out straight into a stop
thrust. Magical glowing metal hit stone and entered a crevice between two
stones with a clang.<br />
<br />
The rock monster seemed to pause for
an instant when the sword penetrated it.<br />
<br />
"Oops," said Boozer to himself. "Out of the
waterfall, into the whirlpool. Yikes!"</p>

<p></p>

<p>     Boozer
stuck the glowing sword into the onrushing rock monster as it flailed wildly at
him. Then he ducked as a huge rocky arm came swinging at his head.
It missed and whooshed overhead.<br />
<br />
Then Boozer
turned and sprinted for the dark passageway. At the end of the
passageway, he exited in a circular white room with two silver pillars standing
in the center. Each pillar was about waist high on a human, and they seem
to hum faintly as he approached them.<br />
<br />
Boozer walked
all around the silver pillars. In the far distance he heard the sound of
sword and rocks clashing together, but it didn't seem to be getting any closer.
Then he walked between the pillars and the world changed around him. He
found himself in an intersection with four corridors leading away into the
darkness. Above each one was a symbol, the symbols being stylizations of
fire, water, air, and earth.<br />
<br />
Boozer felt a
cold breeze spring up, and a momentary sensation of danger, but it passed
without anything happening.<br />
<br />
"I guess I've gotten away from
the rock monster," Boozer mumbled. Now which
way should I go?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>He studied the symbols for a minute and then turned down the earth path. After
walking along for a while, and it seemed as if the walls widened out on both
sides and the ceiling got higher and higher, and the rock underfoot got softer
and greener, and . . .<br />
<br />
All of a sudden he found himself
standing in the middle of a green field under the open sky, and worse, he was
standing there in the nude! All that nice equipment that he had taken
from the Trollgod's armory just magically crumbled away.<br />
<br />
"Hey, Boozer!"
yelled a voice from behind him--a voice not unlike his own voice. 
Boozer turned around and saw a being that looked exactly like
him charging at him.<br />
<br />
"This world isn't big enough
for the both of us!" cried the duplicate.<br />
<br />
"You got that right," said
Boozer. There was a terrible fight.<br />
<br />
Fists flew, teeth tore, legs kicked.
In then end the original beat the duplicate to
a pulp without taking even a scratch of damage in return, and all in a mere 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Still he had nothing to show for it.
Looking around the meadow a bit more, he saw two signs. One said:
"Blue Frog Tavern" and had an arrow. The other said
"Danger and Death" and had an arrow pointing the other direction.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once 
Boozer set out upon the path to the Blue Frog tavern, it was as
if an irresistible force swept him along. As he walked the sky darkened
into night, and the buildings of the city appeared around him. In the
distance he could see a half open doorway with bright light spilling out of it,
and a raucous noise coming from within.<br />
<br />
Just before he reached the tavern,  noticed an old goblin lying in the gutter. The
goblin was snoring loudly, and as Boozer approached he
detected a stench of cheap beer rising from the unconscious one's mouth.<br />
<br />
The old drunk didn't seem to have
much but he did have a ragged brown tunic, a belt, and a small dagger thrust
through it. That was a lot more than Boozer had at
the moment.<br />
<br />
It occurred to Boozer
that he didn't have to walk around completely naked and unarmed. The
drunk was not going to be able to resist if he took his tunic and weapon.
Still . . .</p>

<p></p>

<p>Boozer
stepped fastidiously over his sodden comrade in the gutter, but reached down
and nicked his dagger. Then he pushed open the door to the Blue Frog Tavern and
stepped into the place.<br />
<br />
The Blue Frog Tavern was a typical
Khazan bar, meaning that sawdust covered the floor to soak up the blood and
puke. A dozen tables, along with some benches and chairs filled the room,
a large blazing fireplace filled one end of the room and a wide wooden bar
lined with stools fills the other. Behind the bar was the kitchen entrance.
A swinging front door, four large windows
across the front of the tavern, and a multitude of lit lanterns hanging from
chains attached to the ceiling finished off the simplistic decor. A
wooden door also led into a meeting room in the back.<br />
<br />
Boozer saw
Lucky (the one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged bartender) and Chereva (the hot
centauress bouncer). He scanned the place to see if anyone he knew was
there.<br />
<br />
"Hey," shouted Chereva.
"The entertainment has arrived, and it looks like he started without
us." A roar of laughter greeted this sally.<br />
<br />
Boozer scanned
the room and sees a wide variety of kindreds sitting around getting sloshed.
Ah, there is at least one person there he knows--it's Taran Dracon the
Uruk and his brother Jax. He also sees two wizards, a drunk, a skeleton
man, two ladies of dubious virtue, and a winged toad.<br />
<br />
"Ahem," said 
Boozer</span>, clearing his throat loudly. "I have just
escaped from some sort of magical otherplace . . ."<br />
<br />
"By the skin of your teeth!"
shouted Taran.<br />
<br />
"And I'm on a mission for the
Trollgod to see Lerotra'hh . . ."<br />
<br />
"Looks like she'll be doing the
seeing," snorted the centaur.<br />
<br />
"And I could use a little help. Mainly clothing, and
a drink."</p>

<p>"That's not the entertainment,"
cried Taran, leaping to his feet. "Jax, give me your cloak."
He jerked it off his brother's shoulders and poked two holes in it with
his claws, holes big enough for goblin legs to fit through.<br />
<br />
"Here, step into this,"
Taran told Boozer. Now we fold the front and back up like this and pin
them at the shoulders. Desuma, some pins please." The demoness
snapped her fingers and two cheap broaches (not roaches) appeared. In
less than a minute the goblin was decent again, although just barely.<br />
<br />
"What happened to you,
Boozer?" asked Jax.<br />
<br />
"Magic.  There was this fountain. I took a
couple of coins out of it, and got attacked by a rock monster that stole my
magic sword . . ."<br />
<br />
Heads around the tavern were nodding.
"Yep, yep, that kind of thing happens here in Khazan all the
time."<br />
<br />
Boozer joined the uruk brothers at
their table. Taran signaled for Lucky to bring Boozer a drink, and then
asked, "What are you doing in Khazan, Boozer?"<br />
<br />
"Trying to deliver a package to
the Death Goddess for the Trollgod, but I lost it. Do you think I'm in
trouble?"<br />
<br />
"Don't worry about it,"
Taran answered. "Nobody has seen the Death Goddess in these parts
for a dozen years or so. Just tell His Forgetfulness that she wouldn't
see you."<br />
<br />
"And that a thief ran off with
your package," added Jax. "Hey, Boozer, looks like many of the
regulars are here tonight. Would you like to meet anyone at the Blue
Frog? A better crew of adventurers you'll never find."<br />
<br />
"Hmm," said Boozer looking at the
motley bunch with some dread. As he was thinking it over, Shippy the
Hobbit walked in.

<p></p>

<p>"I'd really
like to meet her," said Boozer, pointing.<br />
<br />
Taran beckoned to the doorguard.
She trotted over to see what he wanted. 
</span>"Chereva, I'd like to introduce my friend, Boozer,"
said Taran. Jax lifted Boozer up to stand on the
table top. From that elevation he could almost look her in the eyes.<br />
<br />
"Well, short, green and
bold," said Chereva, tossing back a flagon of ale that Jax had procured
for her. "Why would you want to meet me?"<br />
<br />
"I've never met a Centaur
before," said Boozer, "and anyway I'm looking
for a ride back to Trollhalla. I wouldn't be much of a burden for someone
as magnificent as you, and I can make it worth your while when we reach the
stronghold of the Trollgod."<br />
<br />
"Hmmm, a chance to get out of
this dump for a while?" neighed Chereva. "Done!
Meet me at the front door at dawn, and we'll be on our way."<br />
<br />
With transportation arranged, Boozer relaxed and partied on through the night with the two
Uruk brothers until sunrise when he trotted off on the back of the most
beautiful Centaur he’d ever laid eyes on.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE END</p>
