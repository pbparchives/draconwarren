"Oh, Mighty me!  Mighty mighty me!" wailed the giant.
<p />
"Hey, you mighty giant," bellowed Quogh as he stepped out into the open, but not too far away from the door.  "How are you doing?"
<p />
"What?  Is someone here?" asked the giant, stopping his chant and looking all around for the intruders.  After a few seconds he
spotted Quogh, Vin, and Dekh slowly approaching him.
<p />
"It’s just us," said Quogh.  "More of the guards for the Dungeon of the Bear.  We’ve come to relieve you."  The tactic had worked
once.  Why not try it again?
<p />
"Come closer," said the giant.  "Will you help me?"
<p />
They slowly approached him.  As they got closer they noticed the giant had the most evil face they had ever seen.  The mouth alone was
a horror--with big flabby lips and black tusks protruding both above and below.  The nose was mashed flat, hardly more than two holes
in the face.  The eyes were small, piggish, and red, seeming to glow with unholy fire.  Lightning bolts were tattooed on both cheeks
and in the center of the forehead was a tattooed red eye.  The giant’s hair stood away from its head like spiky steel nails.  The skin
color was an unhealthy grayish-green.  It wore a loin cloth made of cave lion pelts crudely stitched together.  The body was so dirty
that moss actually seemed to be growing on it in places.  The two huge hands were manacled together with massive steel bracelets and
from the yoke in the center trailed 10 feet of heavy chain affixed to a giant staple meant for penetrating rock.  The filthy giant
stench was horrendous.
<p />
"What’s the matter?" asked Quogh.  "How can we help you?"
<p />
"I’m a prisoner," said the giant.  "Even though I tore the chain out of the wall that held me, my hands are still locked together in a
way that deprives me of my full strength.  Will you get these chains off me?  Will you?  I will reward you well!"
<p />
Quogh and Dekh inspected the manacles.  Dekh found a keyhole.  "It’s a lock," he told the trolls when they huddled together after the
inspection. "I think I could get it off with one or more knock knock spells.  The question is--should I?"

What do they do?
<ol>
   <li>Have Dekh unlock the shackles?</li>
   <li>Leave the shackles on and ask for treasure first?</li>
   <li>Sneak attack the giant while pretending to remove shackles?</li>
   <li>Run away north—it’s a really big giant?</li>
   <li>Run away south—it’s a really big giant?</li>
