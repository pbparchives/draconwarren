Dekh and Vin stared into the faces of feline doom.  Dekh had to look up to do so.  Vin was thinking "we’re gonna die here."  Dekh was thinking "isn’t there any way out of this situation?"
<p />
Vin tunelessly mumbled a little song, "Trollgod told me there’d be days like this.  There’d be days like this,
Trollgod said!"
<p />
The cats attacked, moving high and low, in and out with flashing speed.<br />
(Combat round 2:  Leopard 1 gets 288, Leopard 2 gets 309, Leopard 3 gets 311<br />
Vin gets 221, Dekh gets 372 + 1 spite,  Vin gets 10 points of armor for his rocky hide.  Do the math.  908 minus 10 =
898 minus 593 = 305 divided by 2 = 153 hits to Vin and 152 hits to Dekh.  Vin’s CON is 30, Dekh’s CON is 34.)
<blockquote>
<em>Orchivist's note: Earlier in the game, Dekh took 57 hits and fell to -2 CON, which means he would have had a max
   CON of 55.  Previous to this battle Dekh had 34 out of 55 CON.  Now he absorbs 152 hits and is down to 34.  I can
   only guess that in the interim, Dekh's CON got a major boost but I don't remember how or why.  Perhaps
   real time stat increases were reflected in the game?</em>

<p />
Soooooo dead!
<p />
[Trollgod now imparts a lesson in dungeon delving.  Delve (fight) smarter, not harder.  Use what the adventure gives
you to your advantage.  What has this adventure given you that could help against monsters that are clearly tougher
when taken all together and given room to move?  Not much.  Except, there is an open doorway with walls on the side
and no way for the leopards to get behind them or even attack more than one at a time.  What if . . .
<p />
(Level 10 saving rolls for Vin and Dekh to see if they can think of a way out of this predicament:  Vin rolls 1, 4 and
fails.  Dekh rolls 5, 4 and succeeds.)
<p />
Dekh shook off the vision that showed Vin and he dieing horribly, and looked around.  He spotted the open door, closer
to him than to anyone else.  Only ten feet high and ten feet wide--no room for leopards of such huge size to flank him
and use their speed and numbers against him.  He felt confident that if he could land a single blow in combat, those
cats would be in trouble.
<p />
"Vin!  Get over here quickly!" Dekh shouted as he dashed into the shelter of the open doorway.  Vin saw his plan in an
instant.  Before the leopards could react, he moved behind the goblin, where his bulk almost completely filled the
doorway.
<p />
"I’ll hit them high, you hit them low," growled the troll.
<p />
"If they are foolish enough to attack now," said Dekh.
<p />
Everything had gone the cats’ way.  They sidled closer to attack, but even though the defenders were flanked, the two
cats off to the side couldn’t really attack.  The leader pounced.
<p />
Real combat turn 2:  Leopard 1 leaps in alone.  It gets 286 with 4 spite.  Vin hits it high for 221 + 1 spite.  Dekh
hits it low for 412 + 2 spite..  They get 347 hits on it.  And the leopard is thrown smashed and broken off to the
side.  Vin and Dekh take slight scratches of 2 points each..
<p />
The other two leopards snarl and growl hideously, but they aren’t leaping into that smashing boulder and flashing
sword.  Of course, if they should venture out of the shelter of the doorway, the two leopards would attack where their
superior mobility might make a difference.
<p />
"Woof!  Still alive," said Vin.  "Your plan saved us, Dekh.  Now I have a thought.  What if we just closed the door?"

The leopards are smart enough not to repeat the leader’s mistake.  They will besiege our heroes.  Should they:
<p />
1. Close the door leaving leopards on the outside?<br />
2. Run out and attack the remaining two beasts now that the odds have been evened?
