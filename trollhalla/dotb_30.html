(Everyone rolled two open-ended saves: Dekh made an L11SR vs INT and an L40SR vs LK. Vin made L3SRs vs INT and LK. Quogh made an L1SR
vs INT and an L40SR vs LK.)
<p />
Vin took a quick look back down the wide corridor they had originally come from. Seeing nothing, he turned and headed towards the room
where the spiders had been. If the "bones and stuff" Quogh could see were the remains of some poor delver, there might be a coin or
two--maybe more.
<p />
Quogh was already heading down the short corridor, despite the smoke. The table was still burning, so he smashed it and stomped out
the flames. "Hey!" Vin shouted. "That was dumb. You could have used the boards for as club."
<p />
"Arrth’s Blood--I wasn’t thinking." He salvaged the biggest piece he could, "Better than nothing I guess."
<p />
Something clicked in Dekh’s head as he pulled his Uruk blade from the spider’ corpse, and a wide grin spread across his face. After
quick cleaning on the spider, the scimitar was exchanged for his dirk. A quick check of the abdomen revealed spinnerets--but no
stinger--the head was a different story. Just to the inside of the heavy crushing mandibles were a set of slender and obviously
hollow mandibles. He worked quickly, and managed to recover a substantial amount of what he hoped was viable venom.
<p />
Vin wasn’t happy. He’d found nothing of value, and very little of any use either. The spear--well, what had been a spear--well, at
least it had a silver spearhead that had survived. The bones were mostly animals, a couple rats, a bat-like creature and what looked
like a two-headed bird with ugly green feathers. The last was an Uruk--or maybe a big goblin--but the only thing that was of any use
was a scary-looking helmet with horns and a faceplate, and a big heavy dagger. Unfortunately, they were too small to be of any use to
the big troll.
<p />
Dekh paced out the room as he searched. The room proved to be some twenty feet wide by thirty-five feet long--the long side ran
roughly north/south. The corridor they had entered through was in the southwest corner. The only other obvious way in or out was a big
crack in the wall, up near the ceiling in the southeast corner. There was no way either of the trolls was going to be going that way.
<p />
But... there was something unusual about the wall in the northeast corner. Dekh cast Oh There It Is, and things went to Hell.
<p />
Instead of a nice purple glow, three bolts of painfully bright blue light shot out from where Dekh had expected a secret door. The
trolls were hit almost simultaneously; the bolts engulfed them with crackling energy as they crashed to the floor.
<p />
Dekh was knocked flying across the room. He saw the door slam closed--heard a tremendous scraping of stone on stone from all around.
Then everything went black.
<p />
*********************************
<p />
Vin was the first to come to, but not much ahead of Quogh. "What in Lerotra’hh’s name was that?"
<p />"You got me, but if it knocked me out, Dekh must really be hurting."
<p />
"Actually, I feel almost as good as I did when we started this grand misadventure." the rogue answered. "and, no, I have no clue what
that was. It smells of old magic though--Naga, or maybe even Dragon. Whatever it was, it seems to have restored my Kremm as well as
healing my wounds. It probably did the same to you two. Oh, and check out the weird corridor." He pointed towards the northeast
corner.
<p />
There was a new corridor. If they wanted to go that way, they would have to pass through a "door" made up of hundreds of sparkly blue
lights.
<p />
"I did some scouting while you two were napping. The door is stuck. The crack up there is a tight fit for me, and it stinks like
carrion too. As for the magical door, well, I almost touched it, and it seemed to be... hungry is the best way I can put words to it.
For what, you got me."
<p />
Dekh has 3 doses of Spider Venom.<br />
Quogh has a damaged club (2d6-2).<br />
Vin has a silver spearhead, a full-face helm and a sax.

What shall the delvers do?
<ol>
   <li>Go through the magical door. Who's first?</li>
   <li>Go bash down the door they came in through.</li>
   <li>Something else.</li>
</ol>
(You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice; an example for this turn might be... 
Option #1--Have Quogh throw Vin through the magical door.")
