<h3>Troll Quest</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Tue, 29 Nov 2005 22:12:37 +0800</h4>

Listen now as the Troll God tells you a tale of days gone 
by.   Long ago, the Head Buffalo used to run a solitaire adventure in 
each issue of the FBI newsletter.  He would enter a paragraph from 
something like Goblin Lake, and the readers would vote as to what the 
hero would do next.  Rick would then play out the paragraph and write 
up the results, and the readers would find out what happened.
<p />
Jim Shipman sent me a care package today, and it includes a 
little T&amp;T solo adventure for trolls that few of you are likely to 
have seen.  It occurred to me that it might be fun to play such an 
adventure in Trollhalla.  But with the Trollhalla twist.
<p />
Not only do you vote on what happens next, but speed 
counts.  The first vote received is worth 1000 tvp, the second 950 
and so forth.  Only the first 20 votes received count for what the 
character does.
<p />
And to make it more fun, one of our members will be the 
protagonist, using the attributes that they have established at 
Trollhalla for the adventure.  Trollgod will GM and break all ties.
<p />
Your first challenge on Troll Quest is to choose a Troll to have 
the adventure.  You may all vote once, but not for yourself.  The 
troll who gets the greatest number of votes will be our protagonist.
<p />
The Troll Quest starts now.  Remember, speed counts on this one.

This is a tight, tight contest to see who carries the honors in Troll Quest.
If you haven't voted, now would be a good time. Meanwhile see your next

Deep in Mistywood Forest lies the Troll and Monster village of Srak 
Arhan. It is a fairly prosperous town as troll centers go with about 
thirty huts built from stone, wood, and a relatively high class of 
debris and mud. Among the inhabitants is a powerful shaman and 
several warriors with fierce reputations.
<p />
At the moment, the town leaders are concerned. The weekly shipment of 
ham-beetle meat and turnips has not arrived. Ogmar has always been 
prompt, so foul play is considered a possibility. The elders are 
considering who to send to determine the reason for lateness. Several 
warriors have been nominated: Gimor, K'jherr, Skaat, Dekhurrrsio, 
Dandelion the Ogre, Boozer the Goblin, Verdius, and Khayd'haik. After 
much debate, the choices have come down to Dandelion and Boozer. The 
final arguments sound something like this:
<p />
Ogres are stronger!
<p />
Goblins are sneakier!
<p />
There is much table pounding as the merits of the two candidates are 
considered.
<p />
Ogres are bigger!
<p />
Goblins are smaller and hide better!
<p />
Ogres smell better!
<p />
Than goblins? I don't think so!
<p />
Judging by the dents in the table, the issue would be decided soon.
<p />
If you haven't voted yet, get your vote in. The first choice comes tonight.

<h4>Trollwalla</h4>

For those who are online in Trollhalla, know that in the end, Boozer carried
the day by a margin of two to 1. And so the trolls of Srak Arhan off to do
a Troll's job, albeit a very mighty goblin indeed.

<hr />

<h3>Troll (er . . . Goblin) Quest part 2</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Sat, 26 Nov 2005 20:12:58 -0800</h4>

When the shouting and thumping died down, the elders lined up on different 
sides of the room.  Boozer's side had 11 supporters while Dandelion only had 
five.
<p />
Then it is decided, said old Arrth.  Boozer the Goblin shall go and 
investigate why the food is late.  Someone run down to the Hobgoblin Tavern and roust 
him out.  Tell him to gather his weapons, and get over here so we can give him 
instructions.
<p />
An hour or so later, Boozer appeared.  Someone had explained the whole 
situation to him, but he elected to come in his usual homespun clothing with naught 
but a staff (2d6) and a carving knife (2d6).
<p />
Speed and subtlety, said Boozer, that's how I'll do it.
<p />
Most of the trolls had no idea what subtlety meant.  Dekhurrrsio, the other 
goblin in the group tried to explain it to them, but it was hopeless.  The 
trolls liked the idea of speed.  Though there was still plenty of food in town, 
some of them felt hungry already.
<p />
Boozer knew roughly where Ogmar's house was, so with a burp and a hiccup he 
was on his way, quickly vanishing among the towering forest giants.  He walked 
for half the night, and in the wee morning hours he crested a low hill and 
started down on the other side.  After all this walking, he was beginning to feel 
rather hungry, so when he saw a ham beetle, he immediately went after it.  
<p />
The oversized bug led him a merry chase, and when he finally caught up with 
it and slew it, he found himself far from the trail on an unfamiliar hillside.  
<p />
Off to one side and partly concealed by some trees, Boozer spotted a large 
stone house.  Beside it he saw two standing skeletons of large humanoid 
size--certainly bigger than a goblin.  Their bones were protected by armor and the held 
maces and shields.  The heads turned in Boozer's direction, and they clacked 
their jaws.
<p />
Three possiblities occurred to the goblin.  He could turn tail and try to 
run back to the path.  He could throw something (like the ham-beetle or his 
dagger) at a skeleton and see what they did.  Or he could approach boldly, ready to 
fight if they proved hostile.  [what did Boozer do?]

<h3>Goblin Quest Part 3</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Sun, 27 Nov 2005 14:25:55 -0800</h4>

Boozer saw the armored skeletons start toward him, and he grinned his sneaky 
goblin grin.  Big and slow and scary-looking they might have been, but clearly 
they didn't know who they were dealing with.  He began twirling his staff and 
accellerating toward them.
<p />
(Combat:  Big skeleton 40 plus no spite.  Smaller skeleton: 38 plus 1 
spite)<br />
Boozer: 299 plus no spite.
<p />
By the time Boozer reached them his spinning staff resembled a buzz saw more 
than anything else.  Darting nimbly between the two oversized undead things, he 
broke their ankles, knees, thighs, hips, and ribs before they hit the ground.  
He shattered their spines and punched holes in their skulls, and knocked their 
teeth out.  One flying chip of bone nicked his left shoulder and left a little 
bloody gash, and then the fight was over.  
<p />
"Stupid Skellingtons," said Boozer, a little miffed because he was bleeding 
just a bit.  I wonder what's inside that house.  He went back and picked up his 
ham beetle.
<p/ >
Does Boozer (1) enter the house, or (2) return to the trail, or (3) eat the 
ham beetle?

Other reminders: please use your trollish name when writing to Trollgod.  Makes 
it a lot easier for me to credit you with the points for it.  Note: it's Sunday

<h3>Goblin Quest Part 4</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Mon, 28 Nov 2005 08:18:43 -0800</h4>

Boozer looked at the smashed up bony fragments that was all that was left of 
the skeleton warriors.  He found no sign of internal organs.  These were not 
skeleton men, but magically animated skeletons, and a trace of evil magic lingered 
on the fragments like a stench.
<p />
"I wonder what these guys were guarding," he mumbled to himself.  "Let's have a 
look."  Sticking the ham beetle in a carry-all sack attached to his belt, 
Boozer advanced on the doorway.
<p />
As he walked into the building, he felt a psychic assault as if something were 
tearing at his mind and spirit.  "Arrrrggggghhhhh!" he roared as the 
nonphysical pain washed over him, and he felt an overwhelming urge to just give up and 
die.
<p />
"No, no, no, no!" Boozer bellowed.  "I won't die that easily!  (Level 2 luck 
saving roll--gat an 11--made it easily).
<p />
As suddenly as it had come, the magical assault vanished, and Boozer stood just 
inside the darkened doorway.  "What was that?" he muttered.  "Something evil 
inhabits this house.  The question is: should i go inside and destroy this 
menace, or mind my own business and get back to the trail?
<p />
[Did Boozer: (1) continue into the house, or (2) return to the trail?

As an added benefit of being so popular, any adventure points won by

<h3>Goblin Quest, Part 5</h3>
<h4>TrollMail /  Mon, 28 Nov 2005 19:50:25 -0800</h4>

Boozer hefted the light mace (5d6) and boldly walked down the dark corridor.  
His eyes quickly adjusted to the darkness, it wasn't much worse than outside.
<p />
Suddenly he came to a door blocking off the corridor.  Deep trollish voices 
were coming from the other side of it.  Boozer heard one say: "Something killed 
our guard outside."  Another answered, "And it chased off our ghostly guardian at 
the door."  A third said, "I hope it turned back at that point--it might be 
mighty enough to slay us all."  A fourth sneered, "Nah, impossible, there are four 
of us, and we are each twice as strong as the strongest guard."  "If that isn't 
enough, I have a mighty death spell prepared, but . . ."
<p />
"But what?" the other four asked ominously.
<p />
"But if anyone comes through that door, I am minded to let him join the Death  
Cult of Grethgash the Grisly.  We could use another mighty warrior."
<p />
Boozer knew there were at least five enemies on the other side of the door, but 
he also knew they wouldn't attack him at once.  From the sound of the voices, 
four of them were trolls and one was something else--long odds for a single 
goblin, no matter how deadly.  He wondered if he could take them in combat, or if 
he could outwit them--few trolls could match wits with a goblin and win, or if 
he should just turn around and beat a hasty retreat.
<p />
Did Boozer: (1) storm through the door and attack with the benefit of surprise, 
or (2) knock politely and ask permission to enter, or (3) turn around and get 
out of there as fast as he could?

Final vote on part 5: rush in and attack--9,<br />
Knock politely and be tricky--10<br />
wisely run away--4.<br />
Bwa ha ha, I called for extra votes, and got 2 more run away votes. Ha!
So it was the closest vote yet. Sneakiness carries by a single voice.

<h3>Goblin Quest, Part 6</h3>
<h4>TrollMail /  Wed, 30 Nov 2005 06:22:53 -0800</h4>

Boozer thought about his options.  He could rush in and slay them all, but . . 
. there were at least 5 in there.  Maybe he couldn't.  He could turn back and 
get on with his job for the village, but . . . after being twice assaulted it 
didn't seem right to leave without finding out what this place was.
Soooooooooo . . .
<p />
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  "In the holy name of Grethgash the Grisly, may I come in?" 
he shouted.
<p />
"In the grisly name of Grethgash the Holy, you may!" shouted the High Priest.
<p />
(to be continued)


<h3>Goblin Quest, part 6 continued--Vote now</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Wed, 30 Nov 2005 19:21:50 -0800</h4>

Creeee-ackkkk!  Boozer pushed the door open and walked inside.   He found 
himself in a kind of enormous chapel, eighty feet long, fifty feet wide, thirty feet 
high.  At the far end of the room was a huge altar of black obsidian, and 
behind it was the most horrific statue Boozer had ever seen.  
<p />
"Ar har har!" laughed a creature unlike any Boozer had ever seen before.  "The 
mighty warrior is just a goblin!"
<p />
"A goblin who could kick your ugly butt," said Boozer with a mean smile.
<p />
The chapel held four warriors and a priest.  The warriors looked something like 
wolf trolls, but they were albinos and had short curly horns growing out of 
their foreheads.  The tallest was 18 feet high and swung a flail from one hairy 
paw.  The shortest was only 15 feet tall and had a mace.  They were all wearing 
some sort of strange silvery armor that protected their torsos, but left the 
rest of the body unguarded.
<p />
The high priest was unlike anything Boozer had ever seen or imagined—a giant 
squid with legs wearing a blood-stained red robe.  It had no arms, but a 
multitude of tentacles springing from the bottom of its gray-green head.  No beak like 
a true squid, but a wide shark-like mouth full of revolting green fangs was set 
near the bottom of the head with large yellow eyes set near the top.  It spoke:
<p />
"I am Y’y’y’snotfun, though that is only the short form of my name.  I am High 
Priest of Great Grethgash the Grisly, Greatest of Death Deities."
<p />
When Boozer compared the High Priest to the statue of Grethgash, he noticed a 
definite similarity, except that the statue seemed to be same creature made 
entirely of bone.  Even the tentacles were bony.  
<p />
"I am Boozer, though that is only the short form of my name," said the Goblin 
sardonically.
<p />
"Boozer, we have been impressed by your sheer fighting ability.  Grethgash can 
always use a good fighter.  How would you like to join our cult?  The rewards 
are enormous."
<p />
Boozer wasn’t expecting an invitation to join these guys.  
<p />
"Think carefully now," said the high priest.  "If you don’t say the right 
thing, we might just conclude that you’re too dumb to live, and so we’d have to kill 
you."
<p />
Did Boozer: (1) say he’d be honored to join their cult of Death and 
Destruction, (2) tell them he was on an urgent mission for his village and skip back out 
through the door, or (3) lose his temper and attack them by surprise?
<p />
Remember, speed counts.  I won’t evaluate the winners for the month of November 
until you’ve had a chance to answer this last challenge.  Tomorrow, I’ll count 
the votes, pass out the points, and declare the winners for November.

<h3>Goblin Quest, part 7</h3>
<h4>TrollMail /  Thu, 01 Dec 2005 18:41:12 -0800</h4>

Boozer thought about it for ten seconds or so.  Then he grinned an evil grin.  
"I do like to kill and destroy things," he said, "as long as I get to choose my 
targets.  Yes, I will join the worship of great Grethgash!"
<p />
"Excellent," said the High Priest!  "Come forward and accept the sign of 
Grethgash!"
<p />
"The sign?" asked Boozer.
<p />
"Oh  yes," cackled the High Priest.  
<p />
Boozer gulped, but walked forward.  The priest put a couple of tentacles on his 
forehead and a lightning bolt of pain shot through his brain--two lightning 
bolts.  
<p />
"Welcome, brother Boozer," said the biggest wolf troll.  "Do you feel like 
killing something for the glory of Grethgash?"
<p />
"Yes, I do," said Boozer.  "I feel like killing whoever stole the village’s 
food supply.  Can you help me with that?"
<p />
"Yes, take this wand," said the Chthuloid thing.  It pulled a short wand of 
black wood out from under its robe and gave it to Boozer.  If you have the favor 
of Grethgash, it will always lead you to your next victim."
<p />
Boozer took the wand.  It almost jerked out of his hand pulling back toward the 
forest.
<p />
"Before you go," said the Priest, "Let us give you something."  He handed 
Boozer a bag of gold lions (90 g.p.) and a surge of power went through the goblin 
(900 a.p. for joining the cult of Grethgash.)
<p />
Boozer stashed the cash and let the black wand pull him to his destiny.  As he 
re-entered the woods, the sun was rising.  He ran through the forest, following 
the pull of the wood in his hand.  At one time he came to a stream and stopped 
for a drink of water.  In the morning light, he could see his reflection.  Two 
short curly horns now sprouted from his forehead--the mark of Grethgash.
<p />
An hour later he burst through the trees and saw 6 elves in a wagon--the same 
wagon that usually brought the food to the village.  But they were wary and 
alert--they saw or heard him coming.  "Ware, Goblin!" one shouted.  Two reached for 
their bow and arrows; three reached for swords, the driver whipped the giant 
beetle pulling the wagon into a lumbering run.
<p />
Did Boozer: (1) try to dodge the arrows being aimed at him, (2) charge straight 
at the elves swinging his new mace, or (3) decide that 6 elves against one 
goblin was too long of odds and disappear into the underbrush before they could get 
a shot off?
<p />
Speed still counts.  Get those votes in.

Here's a question for Trollgod - As my attributes go up from gaining TVP,
are the new scores reflected in 'Goblin Quest'? e.g. new adds, better chance of
making SRs, etc.
<p />
I hope so, this adventure is proving quite a challenge for the little Goblin
chappie! :-)

No, the character's attributes are frozen at what he had when the
adventure started. I wrote all that down somewhere.

<h3>Goblin Quest part 8</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Fri, 02 Dec 2005 19:21:15 -0800</h4>

Boozer charged as fast as he could toward Ombar's wagon with its cargo elves 
and the village food supply.  It was just passing him as he came out of the 
underbrush.
<p />
He saw an elf pull an arrow to his ear and let fly at him, and he knew that 
elves never miss.  He threw himself flat and rolled to one side.  (Level 4 DEX 
saving roll to avoid being hit.  Dex 113.  Needed a 4 or better.  Rolled 11.  44 
a.p.) The arrow throbbed into the ground right beside him.
<p />
The second elf waited a second to see if the first elf would nail him.  Then he 
loosed his arrow with an even better chance of skewering this pesky goblin.  
(Level 8 saving roll on DEX.  Needs a 4.  Rolled a 9.  72 a.p.)
<p />
Boozer knew the arrow was coming.  He coverte his roll into a vertical leap.  
The elven arrow tore his boot off as it passed just beneath him.  Figuring a 
third arrow was coming, he caught a low hanging branch and pulled himself behind a 
tree.
<p />
Thunk!  A third and a fourth arrow slammed into the tree trunk.    
<p />
When Boozer stuck his head out from behind the tree trunk, the wagon had 
disappeared into the forest.  A giant beetle being whipped by a frenzied elf can move 
pretty fast when it wants to.
<p />
Boozer recovered his boot, pulled the arrow out of it, and put the arrow into 
his backpack.  Perhaps the village shaman could tell which holt of elves was 
responsible for the heist.
<p />
He had dropped his little black wand while dodging.  He picked it up again.  It 
pulled in the direction in which the elves had disappeared.  He could follow 
them if he wished.
<p />
Did Boozer: (1) follow the elven thieves and try to catch up with them, or (2) 
return to Srak Arhan with the elven arrows and tell the elders that their food 
had been stolen by elves?

<h3>Goblin quest--Part 9</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Sat, 03 Dec 2005 22:04:24 -0800</h4>

Boozer had no difficulty following the wagon through the forest, but it simply 
moved faster than he could with his short goblin legs, and as a result, he fell 
further and further behind.  He also began to tire.  He had been running for 
hours.
<p />
Now the forest began to change its nature.  It became lighter and airier--a 
place more suited for elves than goblins or trolls.  Boozer stopped and scratched 
his head--a thought had just occurred to him.  (L3SR on INT.  Rolled an 8.  
Made it.  24 xp.)  What if the elves left someone behind to ambush him.  Following 
the main trail, he'd run right into that ambush.
<p />
At the very next moment, an elvish arrow twanged into a tree bole not 2 inches 
from the goblin's head.  Either the elf was a bad shot, or it was just a 
warning that he was forbidden to enter elvish territory.  
<p />
Boozer immediately dived into cover and wormed his way forward.
<p />
Then he had a stroke of luck.  He saw the food wagon overturned in the 
underbrush ahead of him, and he heard a loud groan--not an elvish groan.  The black 
wand continued to pull him deeper into elvish territory.
<p />
There were undoubtedly elves hiding in the trees ahead, and the underbrush, but 
probably up on the branches.  Although he wanted nothing more than to slay the 
elves, the prospect seemed increasingly perilous.  He stopped to consider his 
options.
<p />
Did Boozer: (1) rely on his woodcraft to sneak up throught he underbrush and 
slay some elves, or (2) call for a parley to see if he'd be permitted to approach 
the wagon and rescue the injured person, or (3) turn tail and get back to Srak 
Arhan now that he was fairly certain that the thievies came from the nearby 
Everlight Holt.

<h3 id="deathscene">Goblin Quest, part 10</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Mon, 05 Dec 2005 06:23:03 -0800</h4>

Boozer knew that his mace and staff would be too clumsy for working through the 
underbrush.  He laid them aside and thought for a moment.  There were at least 
6 elves hiding in the forest--maybe more.  Some of them would be in the 
branches far above.  They'd all have bows--cowardly elves would never stand and fight 
if they could shoot a body full of arrows instead.
<p />
In fact, Boozer was completely correct about all these things.  One elf had 
gone ahead for reinforcements when the wagon overturned, and there were now some 
20 elves in the area, waiting to see what the goblin would do.  They remained in 
hiding and it became a game of nerves.
<p />
Slowly, slowly Boozer began to inch forward, trying to stay under the 
undergrowth,  He was good, and cautious, but . . .
he moved some leaes, he pushed a stem aside.  He made it nearly ten feet before 
he heard a shrill whistle--a signal from the elf leader to fire.
<p />
They couldn't see him, but they could see about where he must be.  Twenty heavy 
hunting arrows cut into his cover.  Most of them missed or were deflected by 
branches.  Three of them hit him, one in the leg, one in the shoulder, one in hte 
ribs.  (72 hits of damage.)  Boozer cried out--he couldn't help himself.  Nine 
of the next volley of arrows hit him, and 11 of the the third volley.

Three days later Ogmar crawled into Srak Arhan, telling a tale of marauding 
elves, stolen food, and a failed attempt at rescue.  She had been left for dead 
when the elves finally left the scene.  A day later she had regenerated enough to  
pull herself from the broken wagon, and she found Boozer's remains.

The End

<h3>Save Boozer or not?</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Mon, 05 Dec 2005 10:54:36 -0800</h4>

Well the adventuring Boozer pushed his luck too far.  You should all know 
these are no wimpy Disney elves you face in Trollworld--they are mean, cruel, 
capable of warring against Trolls and Dragons on their own ground.  
<p />
But one of our members has written a kind of trollgod ex machina rescue for 
Boozer.  The question you must now all answer is: do we want to make it part of 
the offical Goblin quest archive or not?
<p />
Remember, speed, and being able to spell your own name, counts.

What a bunch of softies you all are!
By a vote of 16 to 7, Boozer returns to the land of the living.
We have Grimtongue to thank for this remarkable saving roll,
made without benefit of dice of any sort.

<h3>Goblin Quest--Epilogue</h3>
<h4>TrollMail / Tue, 06 Dec 2005 06:04:08 -0800</h4>

Although abandoned by all, the corpse of Boozer lay on the forest floor 
as a curious sight to at least one other. She lightly stepped from the 
ancient tree that was her home. Her steps sounded like the rustle of 
autumn leaves and her touch was like the softness of spider silk. The 
goblin was more than a curiosity to her. She ran her fingers slowly 
across the thick brow of the goblin -- leaving a trail of soft sparkling 
dew behind. Instantly, the horns that had marred the trog's head began 
to crack. Slowly, they turned to dark ash and were caught away in the 
gentle breeze that seemed to constantly issue from wherever the young 
woman stood.
<p />
The corners of her mouth raised up in a slight smile. "They never suited 
you anyway," she whispered to the body with wry affection.
<p />
She began to walk slowly around the corpse. Her bare feet left no trace 
of her steps--not even disturbing the dry leaves in her wake. As she 
continued her sensuous walk, each arrow that pierced the body of the 
goblin began to withdraw and the wounds sealed over with new skin. One 
by one the arrows would fall to the ground and, where they settled, they 
turned green, sprouted leaves and wild berries.  As she completed her 
first full circle and all of the arrows had turned into vines, she 
stopped. Reaching down, she touched the gnarled black stick that Boozer 
had been following like a compass. Tracing its outline with her fingers, 
again she left a silky trail of dew on the surface of the rod. For a 
moment nothing happened, but then slowly the dew sunk into the gnarled wood.
<p />
"Nor did this," she spoke, as if continuing her thought, but more with a 
tone of hatred for those that had given the goblin such dark objects. 
Suddenly, the rod's deep black changed to the light reddish tan of 
Hickory bark and several long thin leaves uncurled from the tip.
<p />
Stepping back to look at her handiwork, the young nature sprite smiled 
her approval. "One last thing," she thought to herself. Each of her 
cures were unique and needed to be tailored to the creature being healed 
or they did not work. This was a particularly interesting case and it 
required much thought for a proper waking.
<p />
Slowly, she leaned down to the goblin’s ear.  "Boo-ooo-zzz-er," she 
gently whispered to the goblin as if to charm him back to life. 
"Boo-ooo-zzz-er," again she called but a little louder this time. 
Standing with a smile, she ungraciously kicked the goblin in the 
backside as hard as she could. "Wake up you lazy ass!" she screamed and 
suddenly the goblin began to breath.
<p />
She smiled with pride. "Nice to know I haven’t lost my touch," she 
thought to herself. Before Boozer could roll over and see what was going 
on, there was a flash of light as if it were the glare from the setting 
sun and Boozer found himself back on the trail leading home. Boozer 
thought for an instant he had heard a voice whisper that the hickory 
stick as what he was looking for. As he examined the new rod, curiously, 
it began to tug his hand in the direction of his ham-beetle that he had 
stored in his stack.

Softies indeed! Back in the days of yore, there were no lucky trail-side
resurrections! But I am glad Boozer lives to fight another day - this is quite
fun.

Don't get the wrong idea. It was an adventure--a tale that was told.
We're not setting up a permanent campaign against the elves.
That's Dungeons and Dragons thinking. Time to move on to <a
   href="ogrequest.html">another, totally different adventure</a>.
