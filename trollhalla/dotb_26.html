"Treasure," said Quoghmyre.  "Well, if you put it that way, of course we’ll help free you.  First show us the treasure, and what is
it?"
<p />
"Gold," said the giant.  "Everyone loves gold."
<p />
"Let’s see it first," said Vin.
<p />
"No, first free me, and then I’ll give you your surprise reward."
<p />
"Let us confer about this," said Dekh.  The three backed off about fifty feet and lowered their voices.
<p />
They switched to khargish, so that even if the giant overheard them he wouldn’t understand what they were saying.
<p />
"Do you think he’s planning something tricky--like a sneak attack?" Dekh asked.
<p />
"I don’t think he’s that smart, but just in case, what are we going to do?"
<p />
"I’m going to run," said Dekh.  "Back to the stairway, he can’t get into that."
<p />
"That sounds like a plan to me," said Vin.  "I’ll be holding the door for you."
<p />
"I’ll whack him once just to slow him down," said Quogh.  "Then get out of the way, because I’ll be coming in fast."
<p />
They went back over to the giant.  "All right, put your hands out in front of you," commanded Dekh.  "Let’s see if I can magic those
shackles off you."
<p />
Dekh cast Knock Knock on the manacle lock.  They all heard a faint click, but the lock didn’t open.  He tried again, pouring more
kremm into the effort.  This time the manacles glowed brightly for a second and sprang open.
<p />
As the chain dropped away from his wrists, the giant deftly moved his hands in a circling catch and caught them by the yoke before
they could hit the floor.
<p />
"Die, intruders!" he snarled.  "You’ll never take my treasure!"  He started to bring the wicked chain around in a slashing stroke at
Dekh, but . . .
<p />
Quoghmyre had been waiting, and promptly smote him in the head with his leopard leg club.  The giant’s angry roar turned into a sort
of yelp, and a line of blood appeared on his big bald head as he sat down with a mighty thump. 
<p />
"Ow," said the giant.  "That hurt a little.  Now you die!"
