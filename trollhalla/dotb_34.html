<em>Apologies to all. Before I left on vacation, I trollmailed this chapter, but only to myself. I must have rolled a three on my L1SR
   against INT.</em>
<p />
Quogh tried sitting up against the wall, but everything hurt. His wounds would eventually regenerate. It was a good thing he was a
rock troll. Dekh would have been little more than a smear had he been in front. Even an ogre or a hill troll would be missing
something... important. He spotted the maul lying on the floor and reached for it. It had a good hefty feel... surprisingly balanced.
Solid bronze would make a potent weapon.
<p />
Bracing it against the wall, he managed to stagger to his feet--and just in time. He spotted several figures coming around the corner
on the other side of the portcullis. "Company’s coming! Urooks. They don’t look too tough but they have fire and crossbows." As he
crossed to the near wall, he hurled his table-leg club towards the approaching urooks, but it struck the portcullis cross-ways, and
clattered harmlessly to the floor. (L6SR--needed 19--rolled 8)
<p />
<em>(Editorc's note: I thought it was a leopard leg club?  Hm, I suppose it _could_ hold up a table... anyway on with the
   adventure.)</em>
<p />
Vin was quickly at his side. "How many?"<br />
"Five. No, wait--three."<br />
"Three?"<br />
"One... two... five..."<br />
"OK--three it is. Think we can bust down the grate, Quogh?"<br />
"The both of us together? Not a problem."
<p />
Dekh unslung his crossbow. As he made his way down the corridor towards his compatriots, he became aware of a new "not-voice" in his
mind--the dawning realization that he could use his new helmet to cast a powerful Oh Go Away spell. The cost was considerable, but
certainly worth the sacrifice if the situation warranted it. And it looked like maybe now was a good time to try it out. (The helm can
cast OGA at a permanent cost of 1 WIZ. Otherwise the spell is by the book. This means that Dekh throws an OGA worth 315pts.)
<p />
The air seemed to explode as two--maybe three--firepots hit the portcullis and shattered, engulfing the corner of the corridor in
flames. Vin and Quogh were lucky. What little splattered on them didn’t burn through their rocky hide. Had they taken that full-on...
well there is some truth to the troll vs fire theory.
<p />
"We need to get through that grate, now!" Dekh shouted. "The fire and smoke will be deadly in this dead-end." He silently hoped that
his choice of words wouldn’t be prophetic.
<p />
Quogh tightened his grip on his new maul, as Vin cracked his big stony knuckles. The two mighty trolls spun around the corner and
crashed through the fiery portcullis. Their footing gave way on the slippery, burning floor, and they both stumbled and fell, tangled
up in the mangled grate. As they struggled to free themselves, they saw Dekh burst through the flames--and there was an eerie black
glow around the helm.
<p />
(The two do 640 damage to the grate, but it only takes 500 to bring it down. Both trolls missed L10SR vs DEX; on 4d6, Quogh takes 7
fire damage, Vin takes 6)
<p />
Dekh let a bit of Kremm flow through the helm, and felt a wave of magical power rush out towards the urooks as the spell manifested.
He though for a moment that this was going to work, but then the closest urook sneered and fired its crossbow. Dekh couldn’t figure
out why he was on his back, nor why he was getting cold. Wasn’t there a fire?
<p />
<em>(Dekh’s OGA was not greater than the MR of any of the urooks, and failed. He takes 116 hits from the urook’s crossbow and
   dies.)</em>
<p />
Vin and Quogh weren’t long is disentangling themselves, but it was too late none the less. They looked at Dekh’s corpse, then at the
urooks (two were drawing scimitars, the third was furiously cranking away on an arbalest), then finally at each other. They both knew
what had to be done....
