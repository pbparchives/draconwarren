"Alright, we’re in the dungeon at last," said Vin.  "It’s just like I imagined--cold, dark, and scary.  Can we go home now?"
<p />
"Do we have a golden bear statue for the trollgod?" asked Dekh.
<p />
"Noooooo," said Quogh and Vin together.
<p />
"Well, then, what’s the first rule of dungeon delving?" asked the goblin.
<p />
"Always search for traps," said the two trolls.
<p />
"And we’re doing good," said Dekh.  "We found the first trap really quickly.  What’s the second rule?"
<p />
"Search everything," said Vin and Quogh..
<p />
"Then we better search this pool that we landed in."
<p />
They started searching . . . from the banks, not wading around in it.
<p />
"There sure are a lot of fish with the big jaws," said Quogh.  "What are they called?"
<p />
"They look like piranhas," said Dekh.  "I’ve read that a school of them can strip a cow carcase to the bone in less than a minute."
<p />
"Fish go to schools?" said Quogh.
<p />
"Lucky we’re not cows," said Vin.
<p />
"My friend Fishflower says they are good to eat," said Dekh.  He picked up one that was flopping around on the floor in a drying puddle, whacked it’s head against the corridor wall, and munched it up.  "Mmmm, tastes like fish," said Dekh.
<p />
They found a lot of stunned and dying fish that had been splashed out of the pool when Vin and Quogh hit the water.  They munched them up as they searched.  The meal made them all feel a little better.  (Rest and food help our wounded heroes regenerate.  Dekh now has a CON of 34.  Quogh has a CON of 101.
<p />
"I found something," said Vin.
<p />
"What?" asked Dekh.
<p />
"The place where the water gets out when the pool gets too full," said the troll.
<p />
"I found something, too," said Quogh.
<p />
"What?" said Dekh.
<p />
"A slimy coin, I think."
<p />
"Give to me," said Dekh.  He licked it.  "Yep, it’s slimy," he said.  "Tastes like copper."
<p />
"Here’s another," said Quogh.  "There’s a lot of them around here." 
<p />
"I don’t want them," said Vin.
<p />
"Nor I," said Dekh.
<p />
"Hey, I found something else!" shouted Quogh excitedly.
<p />
They trotted over to see what he had found.
<p />
"Look!  It’s my two boulders that I dropped when the stone ball hit me.  Monsters, look out, I’m armed and dangerous," said the southernmost troll.
<p />
"That seems to be about all there is here," said Dekh.  "Are we ready to go on?"
<p />
"Yes," said the trolls.
<p />
"Okay, then which way do we go?" asked Dekh.  He pointed one direction.  "I sense that the tunnel is shorter in this direction."  He turned around.  "And it’s longer in this direction."
<p />
"And we can get out if we go back up the ramp," added Vin.

<em>
Which way do they go?
<p />
1. Short tunnel?<br />
2. Long tunnel?<br />
3. Up the ramp?<br />
<p />
And for extra credit, what’s the third rule of dungeon delving?
