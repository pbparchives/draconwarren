<em>Bwah-ha-hah!! Score is now Evil GM - 1, Foolish Delvers - 0!! But in T&T, is death always an end?
   <p />
   [Editorc's note: Gimor is referring to Dehks' gruesome death in <a href="dotb_35.html">scene 35</a> of the <a

<strong>Dekh's Saga</strong>
<p />
Dekh wasn't cold anymore. In fact, he wasn't sure what he was - other than buck-naked that is. He stood on a stony, bare-dirt plain
which was littered with decaying corpses. He managed to scavenge a buckler and a scimitar that weren't too useless. Above him, the
black sky held no stars, just a pale moonlike object which gave barely enough light to see. The silence was rent by a booming voice
that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
<p />
"According to the First Agreement with the Nameless One, thou may regain thy life and soul by braving the Abyss. Thy way is dark. May
thy fate be better."
<p />
Dekh became aware that he was standing on a rough cobblestone path.
