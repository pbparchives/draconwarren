There was obviously a well-lit area down the next section, so Quogh stopped for a quick look. The big troll leaned around the corner
of the wall. "There’s an altar about 40 feet down the end of the way, in like an alcove, with a big golden sheep on it. There’s a
couple glowing balls of light to either side. No guards, or priests, or nothing."
<p />
"Then let’s go check it out. Maybe it’s not a sheep, but that bear TrollGod wants us to bring back!" Vin tried pushing past Quogh, but
the big southern troll blocked his way. "First to the treasure but last into danger, eh Vin? Don’t even think about it."
<p />
Quogh hadn’t taken three steps down the corridor when a gout of flame seems to burst from the sheep, accompanied by a tremendous
"BOOM!" This was followed by the sound of rock shattering, as a massive bronze ram-headed maul struck Quogh squarely in the groin. The
force of the impact knocked him backwards, crashing into Vin, and the two trolls landed in a tangle about ten feet from where they had
been. Dekh managed to roll out of the way, and avoided any harm.
<p />
(Yup--roughly shoulder-high on a human--ouch...  Quogh takes 82 hits; Vin missed L10SR vs DEX and takes 8 hits)
<p />
"Aauughh!  Khang’s Bollocks that hurts! Killed by a sheep!" Quogh cried! "Quit yer compaining and get you big arse off me." Vin shot
back, struggling to get disentangled. "One trap always leads to another."
<p />
Dekh had moved cautiously down towards the altar, hugging the wall. A quick Oh There It Is revealed a panel about halfway up the
western wall
"Vin! If Quogh ain’t dead yet, he should be OK for now. Check out the secret area while I check the altar." The glowing balls of light
proved to be melon-sized glass balls, set into crystal sconces mounted to the far wall. They were easily removable, but Dekh realized
they would be both fragile and cumbersome. Would it be worth trying to get them out of the dungeon intact?
<p />
"There’s a latch of some kind here." Vin shouted. Try as he could, his fingers were too big to properly work the mechanism. "Frack
[sic] it all!" The stone panel broke into five pieces when Vin bashed it with his makeshift club.
<p />
Metal scraped on stone as a portcullis dropped into place, tentatively sealing the delvers in a dead-end corridor. "No worried. Quogh
and I can bust it down later.... JOOLS!!!" Vin poured an even dozen small but beautiful emeralds from the bag he’d found behind the
panel. He figured it was a good idea not to say anything about the broken bottle of whatever-it-had-been.
<p />
The altar itself proved to be pretty much exactly what it was intended to be--a way to draw foolish delves down into the trap. The
body of the ram was indeed made of bronze--very heavy--so much so that it was likely not worth trying to lug it out. The rest was
nothing but glitter and show.
<p />
Quogh tried sitting up against the wall, but everything hurt. His wounds would eventually regenerate. It was a good thing he was a
rock troll. Dekh would have been little more than a smear had he been in front. Even an ogre or a hill troll would be missing
something... important. He spotted the maul lying on the floor and reached for it. It had a good hefty feel--surprisingly balanced.
Solid bronze would make a potent weapon. (Good for 10d+10 in combat--STR55, DEX 10)
<p />
Bracing it against the wall, he managed to stagger to his feet--and just in time. He spotted several figures coming around the corner
on the other side of the portcullis. "Company’s coming! Urooks. They don’t look too tough but they have fire and crossbows."

<em>
What shall the delvers do?
<ol>
   <li>Retreat down to the altar--hopefully a bad missile angle?</li>
   <li>Attack the urooks with missiles?</li>
   <li>Try smashing through a wall? If so, which one?</li>
   <li>Try smashing through the portcullis and attack the urooks in melee?</li>
   <li>Something else?</li>
</ol>
(You can ALWAYS include the "Something Else" option with another choice.)
