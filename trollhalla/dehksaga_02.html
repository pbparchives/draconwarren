Dekh became aware that he was standing on a rough cobblestone path--but he was sure it hadn't been there a moment ago. He'd been
scavenging the grisly battlefield. Then again, he really wasn't sure of anything at this point, now was he?
<p />

Looking down, something glinted in the eerie moonlight. He knelt, scraped at the muck and pried the thing loose. It was a gold piece.
There was a nasty looking manticore on one side and an unusual trident-like rune on the other. It was also more than twice the size of
the ones minted in... in... Why couldn't he remember the name of the Death Goddess' city? -->
Looking down, something glinted in the eerie moonlight. He knelt down, scraped at the muck and pried the thing loose. It was a gold
piece. There was a nasty looking manticore on one side and an unusual trident-like rune on the other. It was also more than twice the
size of the ones minted in... in... Why couldn't he remember the name of the Death Goddess' city?
<p />
"Reclaim your soul first," Dekh thought out loud. "Then you can safely worry about everything else. You're on a path and paths are
meant to be followed. Nothing but charnel to either side, so let's see where this leads."
<p />
He managed to wedge the big coin into one of the straps on the buckler. It would stay there, barring a fight. Not wanting to risk
stepping off the cobblestones yet, Dekh took a tentative step forward. When nothing happened, he took another. Then another.
<p />
It was difficult to know how long he walked. What passed for a moon never seemed to move, always clinging to the same spot in the
starless sky. Dekh had lost count of his paces at some point past 1200. He'd stumbled, and decided that paying complete attention to
his surroundings was better than also trying to count something that was unlikely to be of any use anyway.
<p />
The rocky plain had gradually given way to rougher badlands. As the path led him in a tight turn around a ridge, he saw a cave. The
path branched--one fork led there, the other continued down into a cleft in the rocks. There was some sort of beast hide hanging from
a crude frame--a door of sorts--and there was definitely firelight within. Fighting through dulled senses, he picked up the aroma of
roast elf-flesh.
<p />

<em>
Does he...
<ol>
   <li>Approach the cave?</li>
   <li>Continue to follow the cobblestone path?</li>
   <li>Step off the path?</li>
   <li>Stand still?</li>
   <li>Retreat back the way he came?</li>
   <li>Kneel down and examine the cobblestones?</li>
   <li>Something else?</li>
</ol>

As there are a couple new participants, here are Dekh's stats (at least here)<br />
STR-87  INT-62  LK-203  CON-55  DEX-72  CHR-50  SPD-46  WIZ-55<br />
Scimitar:  4d + 360<br />
Bucker: 3 hits<br />
No equipment whatsoever<br />
Spells: Oh There It Is (4) is the only useful spell for this adventure<br />
<p />
For anyone scrying from home Dekh faces a "times ten DRM". I've expanded and changed a few things.</em>
