"You open the door, Dekh . . . . cautiously," said Quogh. "We’ll be ready."
<p />
"I wish I had a weapon," said Vin.
<p />
"Want a boulder?" offered Quogh.  "You can have one of mine."
<p />
"I’ll take it," said Vin.  Quogh handed him a boulder (10D6).  The two trolls stepped back and off to the side. 
<p />
Dekh put his hand on the doorlatch, and slowly started to pull the door open.  At least that was the plan.  But, he
hadn’t opened it more than an inch when a heavy weight hit the opposite side of the door and knocked the goblin
sprawling.  When he felt the door hit him, he threw himself backwards in a roll.  (Level 10SR on DEX.  Rolled a 1,
2--fumble.)  The door still hit him harder than he thought it would and knocked him flat on his back.  He would not
be able to join the first combat round.
<p />
Out into the corridor sprang a snow leopard--but what a magnificent beast!  It made a normal tiger look like a house
cat.  Eight feet high at the shoulder, nearly 20 feet long from head to tail tip, and fast, so fast it was on Quogh
almost before he could get his boulder into play.
<p />
Right behind it came two more, equally as large.  The first one sprang in, swiped, dodged back, even before Quogh
could finish a blow meant to crush its head.  It circled, waiting for the second to come up, but Vin distracted it.
Then the third came on.
<p />
Then it became a mass of whirling combat almost too fast for the eye to see--three giant cats against two giant
trolls.  Dekhurrrsio was stunned by the blow he had taken, but even so he rolled to his feet and groped for his
scimitar.
<p />
(Combat: round 1:  Leopard 1: 296 + 6 spite; Leopard 2: 303 + 8 spite; Leopard 3: 304 + 6 spite.  Total = 903.
Vin Ahr Vin: 226 + 2 spite.  Quoghmyre: 438 + 2 spite.  Total = 664 + 4 spite.  Giving the trolls each 10 points of
armor for rocky skin.  They take 219 hits--109 to Quogh and 110 to Vin.)
<p />
The flashing speed and mighty power of the leopards’ claws were devastating.  They tore into the trollish flesh again
and again, and were barely scratched in return.  The mighty Quoghmyre, already wounded by the demon and not fully
recovered went down, oozing hot magma blood from 20 different wounds.  Vin, who had been unwounded up to this points
staggered back, streaming acidic blood onto the floor.
<p />
For a moment there was a pause as two leopards crouched over the body of Quoghmyre and another advanced snarling on
the badly wounded Quogh.

<em>
There is just a moment when a decision can be made.  Dekhurrrsio rises with scimitar in hand (4d6 + 4).  Vin staggers
back.  Quogh lies unmoving:  Do they:
<p />
1. Fight to the finish?<br />
2. Take to their heels and run away?
<p />
Note:  By Dekh’s own choice, he has no combat magic, and his one healing potion has already been used.
