The leopards scratched and clawed at the door for a while, but all that got them was splinters in their paws.  After a few minutes
they abandoned the door to check on their wounded leader.  It still lived, but barely.
<p />
Then the ambled over to their fallen prey.  The creature looked something like a man, but it smelled wrong, wrong, wrong.  Dark red
blood oozed out of its many cuts.  It didn’t seem to be breathing.
<p />
The female dipped its large rough tongue into the blood, expecting a treat.  "Mrrrowwwrrr!"  It leaped straight up, clawing at its
mouth.  The acidic blood of the troll was burning away skin cells from the delicate tongue.  The leopard rolled over and over in
agony.  Finally, its own blood rushed out of the eroding organ and washed the nasty trollish ichor away.
<p />
They wandered back over to the door.  They pawed at it and meowed, for all the world like two oversized housecats who wanted to go
out.  On the other side of the door, Vin was sleeping, and Dekh had started to explore the hillside, looking for some food.
<p />
Unable or unwilling to eat the rocky-fleshed, acidic-blooded troll, and not cannibals enough to eat their fallen leader, the two
mighty leopards wandered off.  In a few minutes they disappeared from the hallway, and wandered out of this adventure.
<p />
Quoghmyre looked dead—but looks can be deceiving.  Quoghmyre was a mighty rock troll, and trolls regenerate.  He started to get
better.  The cuts scabbed over with hardening blood that looked suspiciously like cooled lava.  The body began to repair itself.  10
minutes later his eyes opened.  (Con back up to +4).
<p />
Quogh had never hurt so badly before in his entire life.  He had never felt so weak.  But he could feel the old trollish magic working
within him.
<p />
Ten minutes later he felt well enough to sit up.  CON = 16.  He saw a dying leopard not far away.  There was no trace of the other two
beasts, or of his companions.  But there was a dying leopard not more than 20 feet away from him.  It, too with the tremendous
vitality of the wild was showing signs of getting better. 
<p />
On the other hand, thought Quogh.  The leopard’s bones would make a nice meal right about now.
<p />
Quogh looked around and noticed that the door in the wall was closed again.  He wondered if the trap had reset.  He wondered if his
companions had given him up for dead and gone on without him.  He wondered what he should do next.
