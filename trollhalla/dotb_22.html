<p />
After some intense but quiet arguing among themselves, Quogh, Vin and Dekh came up with a plan.  They all stood about 20 feet away and
bellowed, "UBBN  INE!"  (Khargish for wake up)
<p />
The two sleeping trolls juddered back to consciousness and shambled erect, groping for their weapons and getting out scimitars.
"HOOYOO?  WUZZUP?"  they asked, glaring around them.
<p />
Quogh stepped forward.  "Snap out of it," he barked.  "We’re your relief."
<p />
"Relief?"  the biggest troll’s eyes widened in disbelief.  "You mean . . ."
<p />
"Don’t get your hopes up!" said Vin.  "The boss wants to see you at the front door.  He said something about a trip outside."
<p />
"Outside?"  Their faces lit up.  "Maybe it’s a raid!"
<p />
"Been ages," said the other one.  "Let’s go!"
<p />
"Hey, thanks for relieving us," said the big one.
<p />
"Not my idea," said Quogh, "but when the boss sez . . ."
<p />
"HAR HAR HAR!" laughed the trolls.  "Yar, he’s a mean little ogre," the other big one said.  Still chuckling, they took off, but not
in the direction from which [Quogh, Vin and Dekh had just come]  They went the opposite direction.
<p />
Quogh, Vin, and Dekh followed them until they reached the water that separated the room in half.  The two trolls stopped at the edge,
bent their mighty legs, and leaped.  They sailed through the air amazingly for such massive beasts, but they didn’t make it across.
There was a tremendous splash, and a wave of water rose up and knocked the Trollhallans back.  When they shook the water out of their
eyes, the other two trolls were gone.
<p />
They searched the room.  The first thing they found was some hand-sized piranhas that had been splashed out of the water.  And they
discovered the trench full of water that stretched across the room.  The room was 70 feet wide and the water went from wall to wall.
In the darkness they could not tell how far it extended in front of them, but certainly farther than a troll could jump.
<p />
Aside from the watery trench, and the tunnel they had entered by, there was nothing of interest in this big dark room.  They tested
the water for depth, and it was deeper than they were tall.  That’s all they could tell.
<p />
They ate some fish.  They rested.  Nothing much happened.
<p />
"No wonder those guys were asleep," said Vin.
<p />
"But there mush be a reason for them to be on guard here," said Dekh, and we should find out what it is."
