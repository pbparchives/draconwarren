Hola,<br />
I think I'll run one more dungeon adventure before I try Tunnelwars.  For 
tvp, tell me your top 3 choices for who you'd like to see go adventuring in the 
next Trollhalla adventure.  You may vote for yourself if you wish.  Get those 
answers in--the adventure starts on Saturday.  And I'm thinking of letting 2 or 
3 go in together.  Let me know what you think of that idea too?

Hola, O Mighty Ones!
<p />
My thanks to those of you who nominated others in my poll yesterday.  There 
were no runaway winners in popularity, and a few more people bothering to write in 
might have changed everything.
<p />
As it is, the race is so close that I'm going to call for a runoff election 
among these candidates.  The top 3 votegetters  will enter the Dungeon of the 
Bear, but since you guys are big and tough, I'm going to up its power somewhat.
<p />
The following candidates all received more than 1 nomination.  No one got more 
than 4.  Please choose 3.

<ul>
   <li>Vin Ahr Vin</li>
   <li>Khayd'haik</li>
   <li>Middleclaw</li>
   <li>Taran</li>
   <li>Dekhurrrsio</li>
   <li>Eee-Gore</li>
   <li>Boozer</li>
   <li>Quoghmyre</li>
   <li>Naharaht</li>
   <li>Rrraff</li>
</ul>

If you're reading your trollmail, please respond and participate.
<p />
Also vote, should the dungeon monsters be 5 times tougher or 10 times tougher 
than they are in the published text.  Trollhalla adventurers will be using their 
Trollhalla attributes and the chosen players will name their own magic and 
equipment before going in.

Greetings, O Mighty Ones.
<p />
    My thanks to all those who voted, and your tvp for it should show up 
tomorrow.  :)
<p />
    It was a very close election with an unexpected result.  Vin Ahr Vin and 
Middleclaw tied for first with 11 votes each.  Quoghmyre and Dekhurrrsio tied for 
second with 9 votes each.  All 4 of you will be going in, which is probably 
good, because the membership voted to make the monsters inside 10 times tougher 
than the printed version.  They've been taking their vitamins.

Here's your backstory:  the four of you decided to go into the Red Uruk range 
and visit the famous Dungeon of the Bear.  You arrived via trollgod 
teleportation express and will leave the same way once you exit the dungeon.  He cannot 
help you while you are inside.  Your attributes are whatever they are tonight on 
Trollhalla, and your gear is whatever you email me and say you are taking.  If 
you know spells, you should specify them--only 7th edition please.  
<p />
Inside the dungeon, your fates will be determined by vote of the trollhalla 
membership, but in deference to yourselves, you each have 2 votes about what your 
own character wants to do.
<p />
Get me that list of character type and equipment carried asap, and we'll get 
this game started.
<p />
H'aaarrrggghhh!<br />
