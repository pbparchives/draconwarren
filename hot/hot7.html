<br />
Thorne is somewhat slight, tall and fair, but hides his light: he dresses in
dark, almost sooty brown; prefers a hooded cloak but cinches the cloak at the
waist. He wears no ornament. (He probably has none.) He's citified, as elves
go. It's a little hard to picture him cavorting in any glades. He's friendly
enough in a quiet way; he's given to a thin smile. He calls the stinks and
sweats of Khazan home more than the forests of his kindred, and speaks little
of his past. He's cut himself from it, and is bent on carving a way for
himself. He's as comfortable with orc as he is with elf. Lately, frankly,
he's been thieving, and is trying to decide whether the call for the hands of
thieves is an opportunity to go straight, or to cut down on competition.
He'll wait and see.

<p />
INTRO-
: Having found the _Sreln Klar_ diamond turned out to be one of the 
worst capers of your life.  Soon after nabbing it from a fence who 
didn't realize it's value, you had great difficulty brokering it off 
for anything approching its true value (which you have heard 
estimated at GP 10,000.)
<p />
: Unwilling to sell it for dirt, travel to a richer, more stable port 
was your only recourse.  As the forces of Zweets and his allies 
continue their deadlock struggle with the scattered and broken 
Khazani Empire, more and more of the trade routes dry up and die.  
Once bustling ports and trade cities and outposts now are either 
abandoned, fortified and xenophobic, or falling under the sway of the 
alien god.
<p />
: Within the last week, dreams which involve the diamond, its facets, 
and travel using mirrors continue to build each night, and in the 
last two days, have even begun to spill over into your waking 
thoughts.
<p />
: Along side those waking dreams, you have been pondering your fate 
in the pirate port of Braecht, along the desolate coast south of 
Khol.  An unnatural storm has been gathering for over three days, and 
on this day, if daytime it is, your magickal senses identify a great 
accumulation of planetary essence.  The wizard's tower is the source 
of this concentration, and with each rainbowed stroke of lightning 
which falls upon the gathering spire, the boundaries of reality fade 
more.
<p />
: Catching a ship to points east may not happen at all...
<p />
=The bar is about the only place to be in public, that is indoors.  
It is patron'd by sea dogs, buccaneers, and outright cut throats.  An 
attractive, buxom, blone haired girl serves a thick, foamy ale and is 
barely able to maneuver through the groping maze to bring your plain 
order to your table.  Perhaps twenty to twenty-five armed men, not 
including the bartender, drink rowdily here...
<p />
=Thunder is crashing almost continuously, and other dabblers in the 
arcane arts also show great dis-ease at the buildup of aetheric power.
<p />
"'ere ewe go mistah..." the girl, Jaqlinne, says in the peculiar 
dialect spoken here.  She smiles briefly, sweetly.  You have seen 
this look on a dozen human girls' faces; girls with no future 
gambling that a non-human might offer them some hope, or at least 
passage out of her doom.
<p />
=Jaqlinne then is roughly handled as she passes between a lot of 
stumble-drunk pirates, at least six in number.
<p />
P: "Give uus the luuv, lass..."
J: "Sir...noo, I beg ahv yah..."
<p />
=The bartender, her father from what you've gleaned, looks up, then 
with a sorrowful face, walks out of the room, and into the storage 
area.
<p />

<em>OOC: OK, I'll bite!</em>

IC:

The unfolding scene has been watched, up to this
point, by a charcoal-clad and hooded blade sitting
alone(as alone as one can in such close quarters)
across the bar. At this point, he "hastens slowly"
through the crowd, silently until he is all but atop
the Pirate closest to the hapless serving wench.
(Palming his dagger under his cloak with his left
hand, so as to be unnoticed by the brutes.) He brushes
back the hood enough to show his thin, elvish face and
a shock of fair hair.  In a smooth, dryly jesting
voice clear enough to be heard: 
<p />
"Boys, this lass' got sauce, but not so much as you
can share it with all here. Best unhand her and leave
her to her work, or all here must get their own drinks
without her! If you're lonesome, you must needs drown
your sorrows properly, so I'll stand you seamen a
round... and you may even get it, too, IF you'll leave
the lass about her business."
<p />
OOC: IF the pirate doesn't settle and unhand her,
he'll find a handful of his hair in my hand, cranking
his head back for the dagger at his throat.

<hr />

<h3> 4833 - Shrsholn - Tue Feb 18, 2003 9:53pm</h3>

<span class="t5">THREAD 5: Thorne</span><br />
= With a fistful of the pirate's greasy, matted hair in Thorne's 
fist, the place grows eerily quiet.
<p />
In the same instant that daggers or cleavers are readied, a pulse of 
magickal energy rips through the area.  Lesser magickers are 
immediately overcome and pass out, sparks dancing above the crowns of 
their heads.
<p />
This is enough to allow Thorne one Round of action before others can 
react.

<span class="t5">THREAD 5: Thorne</span><br />
Can it be that there is some manner of magical bouncer at work? Thorne's head
spins as he scans the room (O GM, What Danger doth he Sense with his Sense
Danger?) He guesses that this is the case, releasing the pirate (preferably
bouncing his nose off the table as he does so) and palming the dagger back
into its sheath on the offchance that he's right. He springs to the side, in
such a way that his erstwhile foes are all visible, and makes ready to react.
To any listener whom it may concern, he calls: "I'll have no trouble on my
account, but I'll not watch and see a lass molested with none to aid her. If
you are so keen to avoid mayhem that you magick the place, tune it more
sharply to aid your employees in their need!"
<p />
IF the pirates continue to press an attack (unwisely, under these
circumstances I should think) Thorne'll respond magically, probably with
blasting power.

Since Thorne seems to be wrong about his guess re:

best to get clear of the crowd so he doesn't have to

effect could be coming from, though in this terrible a dry lighting
storm, it is an unpalatable choice to investigate at such a late hour.

There are enough provisions here for Thorne to replenish his supplies

Rogan needs to be leveled-up using my funky method.
<p />
Distribute a total of 06 points as desired among your Prime Abilities
(yes, even SPD and MYS).
<p />
This will bring Rogan up to 7th level in my game (one Ability Point
is gained at each Level, rather than the book method).
<p />
There are also skill choices to make.
Rogan's INT (IQ) score is the number of Skill Points available to the
character.
<p />
email: skills@darkcosmos.org for a copy of the skills list, or
better yet, just write your own choices.
<p />
Skill Ranks usually add to a pertinent Ability score on a Saving Roll.
So, if Rogan had Combat Archery at Rank 03, all Bow-attack SRs would
be at 17, rather than DEX 14.
<p />
Unarmed and Melee Weapon Skill Ranks add directly into the HPT the
character generates in dice + adds combat.

Once Rogan is Skilled, we'll get him/her/it in the game.

Okay, to entrench you in the new Chiliad Arch plot:
<p />
Rogan, your employer of late has been the Khazan Internal
Intelligence Legion (KIIL), headed by Khara Khang. You were sent out
to assist another KIIL agent, Dijani K., in the pursuit of capturing
or killing a rogue agent, Willim Dritauge, and his accomplice,
Spurlious Trask.
<p />
Your travels brought you first to Khol, a decrepit, backwater canal
city on the south-eastern cost, where you caught the trail of an
adventuring party also after your quarry.
<p />
Then the trail stopped cold.
<p />
After much consternation and footwork, Rogan, you have found your
way to the rocky coast, where Trask's patron, the disbarred Wizard
Bjolfe, dwells in a tower (natch').
<p />
Braecht is the only named town in proximity to the tower, though he
holds over forty serfs, and is rumoured to traffick with monster-
types.
<p />
A daring elven fellow has recently flamed a crowd of hostile pirates
in the same tavern you were resting in.
<p />
You too felt a great magickal surge which depleted all but 1d6+3 of
your MYS points.
<p />
This other fellow took charge, and set out after the wizard.
Accompanied by the serving girl, Kerah, you believe you heard her
name.
<p />
The pirates are licking their wounds, debating going after the two
and doing things most dire, but then all think it best to leave them
to the evil wizard.
<p />
The magickally-foul weather has suddenly calmed.
<p />
The air outside is heavy with moisture, but the air is perfectly
still although black clouds hang over the area...

I believe that's actually `mock pig-latin'.
True pig-latin would read as follows:
`At'sthay a-ay igbay IXNAY onay ethay ostpay, okayay?'
<p />
A common error.
<p />
Correction- it seems `That Wench' was not released on DVD, it was
`That Girl', an entertaining Marlo Thomas TV comedy circa `66-`71.

My apologies if anyone went running off to nasty buildings with

I rolled 3D6 and got 13, multiplied by 40 giving Amos a total of 520gp.
I bought him a Hand-And-A-Half Sword, a Tower Shield, some Scale Armor, a
Single Bladed Broadaxe, a Pick Axe, Warm dry clothing and pack, and some Knee
High boots. After all this, Amos is left with 120gp.

History<br />
......At the beginning of Logan's story, Logan was a fine Tweenage
Halfling Rogue (thief), out to begin his adventuring career. He and
eleven other low level Rogues were hired for a relative pittance by a
10th level Warrior. This guy had found a dungeon of mainly traps and
been the single survivor of his party. So we were along on his second
attempt as trap-finder/ fodder. So we troop along, and all would have
been fine and good if he would have let some of us have some of the
treasure, but oh no! Every time the corridor traps were thru and the
door was opened, in he would rush, start gathering, and attack us if
we tried to find anything for ourselves. Finally, at one point, Logan
had had enough. Detecting an unactivated trap in the chest he was
about to open, he let the warrior thrust him out of the way and open
it, and the warrior then took 3 poisoned bolts in the stomach. As
that worthy began to convulse and over the course of a couple of
rounds find and take the right potion, Logan found a magical belt
which he put on. It made his strength as the strength of a Giant
(Storm Giant actually). The warrior objected that it shouldn't work
for a Rogue, that it was a magic item that only worked for Warriors
(another flaw of AD&amp;D). Logan renounced Roguery and became a Warrior,
and the belt began working on him.
<p />
.....From that moment there was no looking back, except that in the
course of his various adventures Logan managed to travel to different
worlds, and each interpreted the magic of his belt slightly
differently. In one he had the muscular strength of a (Storm) Giant,
but not the skeletal strength of a Giant in such a way that when he
used one of his favorite moves (party thief hears monster-breathing
immediately on the other side of the door, monster obviously waiting
for party to cautiously open door so it can attack, Logan punches the
door, breaking it open and causing some shrapnel damage to waiting
monster), the stout wooden door opened but it was his arm-bones that
shattered. The party was ready to leave the dungeon anyway, and as
the treasure was being divided, Logan took one wish from a ring of 3
wishes as his portion. Then he wished: "Without this wish directly
causing harm to anyone, anywhere, I wish that in everything save
size, weight, and appearance, from now on I am a (Storm) Giant."
......Needless to say, adventures continued and got more
interesting... Logan can hold his breath an amazingly long time
(actually, he can breathe water, but he hasn't really noticed, and if
this part doesn't translate into your T&amp;T world (as it has not in a
couple of others) I will understand) and he almost always makes his
saves versus Lightning (immune to damage from electricity, ditto).
<p />
Logan's Possessions<br />
Sky Blue Silk-Steel Bodystocking (Magical silk, stops as if steel
(10) on the outside, self-repairs under natural sunlight (1 inch of
cut per hour) );<br />
knapsack (worn over Bodystocking);<br />
Box of everfull Lembas (5 per day) in beltpouch 1 (worn under
Bodystocking);<br />
165 Gold, 28 Silver in beltpouch 1 ";<br />
2 Gold, 12 Silver, 35 Copper, 16 Brass Farthings in neckpouch;<br />
an 8x Bota of water (1 quart on outside holds 2 gallons inside);<br />
an 8x mini-Bota of Continual Lighted (or equivalent) oil (1 cup
outside holds 2 quarts inside);<br />
an 8x mini-Bota of Continual Dark-ed (or equivalent) oil ";<br />
2 pitons (in knapsack);<br />
3 hollow latex balls (like medieval tennis balls);<br />
leather belt (worn outside Bodystocking);<br />
beltpouch 2 " (contains 50 1/2 inch diameter steel balls and a
powerful magical magnet (usually used for collecting them after
combat);<br />
2 spring-loaded, lockback slashing manople-blades (1 on each forearm,
worn outside the Bodystocking)
<p />
Recent History and entrance to your world<br />
...Logan and several others had been taken as 'long lasting snacks'
by some vampiric demons (or demonic vampires), when a previous enemy
Wizard (enemy of the demons') attacked. An interdimensional vortex
appeared, sucked everyone up, seperated them from each other, drained
levels from some, added them to others, and spewed them out
seperately on different worlds. The chests of treasure he'd been
carrying for first the party and then the demons were gone, but
Logan's personal items were all attached to him (a lesson he has
learned from long ago).

Shrsholn currently is out of town and hasn't forgotten about us. She
also wanted me to let you know that she's not ignoring you (the new
player to HoT) and that when she gets back things will get moving
again. I have a couple of outstanding questions for her before I post
for Taran, by the way, in case you're wondering why I haven't posted
for everyone's favorite other orc brother. ;)
