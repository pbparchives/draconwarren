APPEARANCE: 
<p />
Creamy cinnamon skin; Raven hair (worn long); Indigo eyes.
<p />
When uncloaked, Dijani's developed musculature seems somewhat a contrast to
her otherwise unblemished feminine curves and softness.
<p />
Her clothing tends to be simple, utilitarian affairs; cloaked tunics, almost
exclusively in black, though she does on occasion wear purples and reds of
the same basic sort.  Her cloak-clasp is a strange, vaguely like a silver
sun, emanating wavy, tentacle-like rays.  Her gloves are custom tailored -
gifts of her employer - exhibiting a sort of thin mesh bonded to the soft,
kid leather of the interior.  Her soft, calf-high boots are waterproofed and
brass-toed.
<p />
Her armor (under her clothing) is a bone and sinew lamellar from the
uncivilized isles to the east of Ralph.  She employs a small leather and
shell shield.
<p />
Dijani is usually armed with a hidden half-dozen daggers and knives, as
well as clearly displaying her trusty shortsword, sheathed in a fine
scabbard.<br />

<span class="nb">Editor's note: Following is excerpt of Shrsholn's house
   rules concerning wizard-warriors.</span>
<p />
WIZARD-WARRIORS
<p />
	Characters who have all eight prime ability scores of 12 or higher before any kindred modifiers are the only ones who qualify as 'Wiz-Wars'.
   <p />
	Wiz-Wars enjoy great latitude in their mode of operation; taking the best of both the melee and magickal training they received.
	They have no weapon restrictions, and they receive a bonus of +01 with the armor and shields they employ.
   <p />
	They receive a combat bonus equal to half-again their character experience level versus both material, and immaterial opponents.
   <p />	Wizard-Warriors are able to cast magicks without restriction, and are nearly as potent in this field, as true Wizards.
   <p />	They are able to employ foci, and are able to benefit a lesser degree from the rote usage of magicks, reducing the ESS cost of spells by one-half their level.
   <p />	However, even these individuals are unable to devise new magicks.
   <p />
	Players wishing to play a Wizard -Warrior may solicit the GM prior to rolling their prime ability scores, and with the GM's permission, add and re-roll triples on the dice, thus increasing the likelihood of generating such a superior creature.
   <p />	However, if the rolls should fail to generate a Wizard-Warrior, the player must play a Rogue instead.
   <p />
	Wiz-Wars beset by damaging magickal effects add half-again their ESS score as magickal resistance to the damage.
