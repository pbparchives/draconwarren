<p />
[[Taran]] Having had no time to hulch in disbelief at the fantastic
events that transpired so quickly back on the other side of the arch,
through the arch, and beyond the arch, Taran tried to dismiss them
still as he ran after the man he knew only as Trask, a man whose only
connection to himself were orders from the orc shaman Arahk Gnahk,
posing as the wizard Khara Khang (as he believed the correct facade to
be). Orders to stop him, then orders to chase after him, through the
mystical arch.
<p />
Having settled into the pace of the chase, Taran briefly turned his
attention to the human female running alongside him. Neither had
thought much in the way of introductions, sparing only moments to take
in the amazing scenery and its effect on their breaths. "Ugh, who are
you?" he grunted to the woman in his typical brusque orcish mannerism,
which was accented with audial jolts by his clumsy sprint with a
crossbow in hand and impaired dexterity [due to the drain the worm
placed on him for opening the portal to get into this adventure in the
first place!]. She'd jumped at Arahk's orders just as quickly as he
had, and he'd automatically grouped her into the camp of allies. He
hoped that was actually the case.

[[OOC]] Ok Shrsholn, I'm in! I have many many questions, but instead
of trying to spoil the fun of discovery, I'll try to hold most of them
back. One I would like to ask is if Taran and Dijani's character
sheets need to be amended or updated in any way for thier stay in
Aqmlk/Blood. Also I want to make sure our stats are in order--see the
archive site for our latest stats including drains to INT and DEX for
Taran and a very low CON for Dijani. Also, I have Dijani's essence as
18+ since I don't know how much more above her previous max of 18 she
gained from the transfer from Silkervish. Plus, does Dijani still
feel as if she can cast spells? Does Taran still feel magically
connected to his wizard symbiant worm? How badly do they feel like
fish out of water?! Ok, I guess I had a lot of questions after all, LOL!
<p />
Looking forward to the continuing adventures...<br />
--Ben/Taran the ORC!
<p />
P.S. Anybody else want to come along for the ride? (Hey, the more
friendlies to watch Taran's back, the better!)

1). Dijani feels as though she may be able to cast her spells, but knows
that magick functions here.  She senses it.
<p />
2). Taran feels connected, but the symbiot has gone into a torpor-state,
unresponsive, but still intact/alive/etc.
<p />
3). Both are effectively at 3/4 or 75% effectiveness.  This means that until
acclimatised (works in the movies...), they have 3/4x their scores (and the
subsequent modifiers generated by such scores), equally affecting their
Combat and SR results.
<p />
Ben, look at the Guild Houses of Blood Installment 2 in the new TROK
when it comes out.  That's how I'd like the characters organised, but I'll
be glad to help you out -- especially with "Orc" stat conversions. <
mischevious giggle>  Taran ought to have a howling good time.

Nope, didn't miss anything. When he went through the Chiliad Arch to

[[OOC]] For all Jax knows, Taran has just skipped town to try to
find his gear (which he left aboard the Night Gail) and his loot
(which his Elvish ex-lover stole). Jax probably figures Taran is
having a mid-life crisis and just needs to get out from underneath
the shadow of "the handsome Orc brother." ;)
<p />
But this is assuming that Taran's offworld jaunt occupies measurable
time with respect to Trollworld. If Khara's next installment occurs
before Shrsholn finishes her game, then we'll probably go with this
assumption.

I'd love to continue his Mars-adventure as an abekgorru (spelling is wrong,

please let me know and I'll figure out some kind of deus ex machina to get him

I will do some deus ex Machina

him into Middleclaw's game he's cooking up.-->
In the meantime, I guess I won't
convert Taran into a Mars planet dogman anyway, and do something clever to pull
him back into regular Trollworld with his buddies.
<p />
If you have even the slightest interest, will you award any AP or any wierd
side effects for Taran's brief tenure in HoT and even briefer appearance on
Aqvlk?  <span class="nb">[sic]</span>
And also any AP for Dijani's more extensive participation in HoT?  I
completely understand if you don't want to even think about this anymore.  I
suppose I should request you hand out APs for all the surviving characters, but
I think the folks other Dijani didn't do much anyway (including Taran).

<!--

Nice post by the way, but I would add a line at the end of your post where
Taran reappears in Khazan. Maybe reappearing on a slick rooftop to hang from
a gutter (like in Goblins In The Mist). Heh. A Talo Worm jump can jump hosts
and it would certainly not ask permission, and it would always go to a more
powerful host. If Taran couldn't support the worm, and Dijani could, then the
worm would just jump to Dijani. I always thought of the Talo Worm as more of
an entity in the back of your mind giving you hints of things to do (like a
Devil or Angel on your shoulder). At the end of the day, Taran should
probably lose the worm as it sends Taran home to Khazan (just my opinion).
The Talo Worm is way over used and abused (again just my opinion), also, keep
in mind, it's been 2 years since Taran disappeared. Seven days remained in
the Month of the Serpent of the Khazan year 1317A.K if you wanted the exact
date as of now. Merry Christmas, and I'll be cool with whatever you decide to
do (short of killing Shipy, for that you have to get in line)..:)

<em>[[OOC: When last we saw our intrepid heroine and hero, the wounded
human female warrior-wizard Dijani and Taran the orc male warrior had
run through the Chiliad Arch after Spurilous Trask, on order by Arahk
Gnahk. As they sped across the surface of Aqmlk, Taran introduced
himself to Dijani whom he had just met (see post 5684).
<p />
The GM, Shrsholn, intended to transform the campaign into one set on
her fantastic world of Aqmlk (see post 5818). But plans could not be
acted upon, and now "The Reward for the Hands of Thieves / Chiliad
Arch" adventure officially ends with this post, as extracted from the
minds of tarandracon and dijani_k, as sanctioned by Shrsholn, and as
approved (on matters regarding the worm) by khara_khang.

the following epilog / final move at the archive, with all it's pretty
colors. Heh!]]</em>
<p />
<hr />
<p />
[[Dijani]] "My name is Dijani," Dijanirhean Katarin said. Her
assessment of the orc was simple: yet another grunt enlisted by her
thin list of allies. She trusted him as far as she could throw
him, but for now he seemed intent on capturing Trask, so she wasn't
about to interrogate his motives.
<p />
[[Taran]] "Dijani? Ok. Well then, let's carry on!" he shouted as
they continued their pursuit.
<p />
Dijani felt she could have cast a spell to aid in Trask's capture,
but she was very wary of doing so. The place they had arrived
buzzed of magic--she could sense it--but it also brimmed with
unpredictability. This gave her caution and she heeded it, being
extremely wounded herself.
<p />
Taran knew he couldn't easily load his crossbow while running, and
he didn't want to pause and lose ground in order to load the weapon.
He quickly holstered it in its shoulder holster.
<p />
Ultimately, then, it was a foot race.
<p />
Alas, despite their earnest pursuit, the atmosphere's taxing
effects on their bodies was too great for them to sustain the run
for very long. Spurilous Trask, for his part, had only increased
the distance between himself and his pursuers. As if he were
accustomed to the air and felt no ill effects from it! Taran
wondered if Trask had used the portal to get to this place before.
The thought of portals shifted his attention to his Talo Tattoo
Worm symbiont. Usually he didn't feel it physically, but now that
he dwelled on it, it seemed the thing was pulling at his skin,
perhaps his very life. Just as Taran struggled to draw breath, he
wondered if the worm were struggling. Suddenly the task of
stopping Trask seemed unimportant. The suggestion of this
reprioritization soon became an uncontrollable obsession and Taran
stopped in his tracks, no longer in control of his own actions.
<p />
[[Dijani]] "What?!" Dijani barked, noticing Taran's sudden halt.
She looked ahead. Trask was almost out of sight. She sighed and
slowed to a halt, then walked back to the orc. Alone, she might
continue the pursuit even if it meant tracking after he was gone
from view. But alone and injured she would never subdue him, she
knew.
<p />
[[Taran]] "This host is a fool!" Taran spoke, spitting. "I can not
survive here! I will not die here!" Taran's gaze at first was on
the horizon, but then he sniffed the air, and looked straight at
Dijani. "You! You have power! Give it to me! I will open a
portal and we can leave this place. This host does not have the
power I need to compensate for... here." Taran's eyes had glazed
over. It was clear to Dijani what was happening. This orc was under
something's control. It fascinated her, yet....
<p />
[[Dijani]] "I will not leave without my catch," she offered angrily.
<p />
[[Taran]] Slumping to the ground, Taran's eyes began to roll into
the back of his head but then the focus returned, obviously more
weakly than before. As Taran shrinked into a tired crouch, the orc
wheezed. "I am your only chance. Give me some of your life essence!
This... world... is too foreign! I require more strength than this
host can... offer...."
<p />
[[Dijani]] "I can run back to the arch and return when I like. I
don't need you and I am not threatened in the least. Look at you,
you're pathetic!" Dijani was confident she could retrace her steps.
But she was definitely touting bravado in claiming the arch would
not only still be there but also open for travel back the way they
came. Now she was even more angry. Her only ally was an unstable
mix of personalities, and now he presented himself as her only hope?
It was absurd.
<p />
[[Taran]] "The arch... is closed to us. You know I am right.
You... are wasting time." Taran drooped again and was now laying
on the ground in a lump of strengthless flesh and armor. His
breaths were even more shallow than before.
<p />
[[Dijani]] Dijani sensed that Taran--or whatever was speaking
for him--was correct, and that the orc would not survive if left
to his own devices. Somehow she knew she was cut off from her
homeworld, that the portal had closed. She suspected it might be a
one way trip, but never dreamed it would take her offworld. How
would she get back? She typically thought the return trip would take
care of itself during the quest. Only the adventure itslef, the
hunt, the catch, mattered.
<p />
Dijani looked around. For the first time she realized she was out
of her element so completely that it scared her. It made her
uncertain of her own survival. She bent down and removed her
custom-tailored gloves, stuffing them in a pocket of her tunic.
Grabbing the orc's face, she drew upon the essence she'd absorbed
from Silkervish and willed it into the orc at her feet. It wasn't
so much a skill, or spell, but some kind of innate ability she
instinctively surrendered to in order to accomplish the task.
"Damn you orc, this had better work." Her breath billowed out in
vanishing clouds of moisture between her gritted teeth and grimacing
lips.
<p />
A headrush accompanied a sudden transfer of power, and soon she felt
the power draining from her as if pulled. After a few seconds,
a magical portal opened with a crackle and light show. Taran
quivered slightly as his eyes fluttered, and this made her raise
an eyebrow in curiosity. "Such... power..." the orc whispered, and
he stopped breathing. Dijani's hands suddenly went cold and she jerked
them off his dirty brown-green face. She felt sluggish, yet
at the same time, she seemed herself again. The essence she had
absorbed from Silkervish caused her to feel swollen, even bloated,
and she never realized it at the time with the phenominal sense of
might it gave her. In a way she was glad to be rid of it.
<p />
<em>
[Dijani's <a href="dijani.html">ESS drops from 18+ to 10</a>,
having given all the surpluss, and
then some, to Taran. Taran's
<a href="taran_dracon.html">INT drops from 6 to 3</a>, and his
<a href="taran_dracon.html">DEX drops from 8 to 5</a>,
from opening the portal. I establish that the foreign
magical landscape was so incompatible with the talo tattoo worm that
it needed more than its own magical ability to create a portal
successfully. But where was it leading Taran now?]</em>
<p />
The portal held only darkness inside. She could not see what lay
beyond, but she had a sense that whatever was on the other side
was a cosmos away.
<p />
Having trusted the orc, Dijani could not leave him behind now.
Urgently, she picked him up. Taking one last glance at the stars
that streaked in the horizon as if they were tethered and could not
escape or fall, Dijani gritted her teeth. She spied the horizon in
the direction she has last seen Trask. "So I fail in my quest."
Dijani proclaimed a curse under her breath. "May another claim
your hands for reward, thief! Death Goddess help you, if she even
has influence here...."
<p />
With a shallow breath of frigid air, Dijani stepped through the
portal, which swallowed them hungrily. Twenty seconds after the orc
symbiont's power had opened it, the portal closed with a whimper.
Soon, the dust swirling about Aqmlk's surface quickly removed all
trace of the sprinters' brief journey.
<p />
<hr />
<p />
<em>
[[OOC: And so it ends. Or begins? Where and when will Taran and
Dijani pop up? That tale is for another GM to tell. But at least
they are now free for other adventures and are not stuck in
game-limbo on Aqmlk.
<p />
Inquisitive minds may wish to wonder why, if Taran was too weak for
the worm to open a portal to escape Aqmlk, why the worm did not jump
hosts to Dijani who was brimming with Essence (aka Wiz, or Kremm, etc.
as used in Shrsholn house rules). I establish that it was too weak
even to make that jump.]]
<p />
Shrsholn, it was fun while it lasted. Good luck with whatever
adventure is in store for you next!
<p />
Happy New Year's Eve, everyone!
