Dijani moved
slowly in the shadows. This was indeed where the liason
told her to be, but something felt afoot in the air,
something that was menacing. She wondered what this job for
the goddess would be, and who it involved.

<span class="t3">THREAD 3: Dijani</span><br />

Dijani, reflecting on
how she innocently undertook this perilous mission,
now finds herself in a nameless hamlet nestled in
coastal foothills, some week's journey overland from
Khole.<p />A magickal storm has been conjured here, and the
thunderous hammerblows have begun to deafen Dijani now after
two or three days.<p />Also, the rain and wind is
strong but intermittent, swirling about, as if the
elements were at war with each other.<p />The last few
days you have spent in difficulty spying out the
hamlet. You have noted several thiings amiss, namely a
marked lack of human activity -- even within shelters;
no visible livestock of any sort; and the
unmistakable signs of gremlins -- lots and lots of
gremlins.<p />As she is stooped down for cover, observing a
nervous band of hamleters rush out quickly to the only
well, while others guard the home with pitcforks and
staves. Of the three who ran to the well, two are
similarly armed, perhaps with a knife affixed to the end of
a short staff as a makeshift
spear.<p />Harriedly, the one lowering the bucket tries to reclaim it's
precious contents, but upon bringing the bucket to the lip
of the well, three scaly, cat-like creature --
gremlins -- leap, one each, upon a man.<p />As the
dread Lasagna Cat of Khazan is known to be able to
devour an entire family serving of the aforementioned
dinner, so too, these fearsome felinoids scrabble and
claw these poor, hapless folk.<p />Outraged, Dijani
attempts to maintain her composure and her cover, all the
while crying out within to come to their aid...no good,
she can't hold back.<p />Practically flying there,
Dijani's nickle-plated shortsword glints in a flash of
lightning from the storm pummling the hamlet.<p />With one
stroke, a gremlin is launched from his victim to the
age-old cobblestones, and does not stir.<p />With another,
the bucketeer is saved from his clawed attacker, and
this one too shall not rise.<p />Ah, but the
third...<p />[2nd Level SPD SR, please]

bluntly.<p />Escemine and Silthis, and the Orc look as if they have all
come to the conclusion that this was probably their
worst job they'd ever taken -- and quite possibly end

Kellis says, shuffling in mental shock at the sheer
carnage in the tunnel; the armed and armored
ogre-zombie..."If I should live to tell the tale -- they'd never
believe me...", he continues, looking
astonished.<p />There is silence for a few moments as everyone prepares
to embark on the next phase of this
tunnel-trek.<p />Kellis picks up the discarded stiletto, and looks as if
he'd received a slight jolt, but then taps the flat of

tossing it and catching it with extrordinary talent.

she holds it palm-up, stretches her fingers out, then

sealed off the tunnel leading to the hot spring and
river. There are two tunnels, one leading directly into
town; the other out toward the coast.<p />The
townward tunnel looks to be of old, but sturdy, possibly
even dwarven-assisted, construction. It appears to be
used frequently, and Elise's tracking skills tell her
that it surely leads to another spot worth
investigating.<p />However, the skelletons have reported to Lady Silkervish
that there is definite activity coming from the
coastward tunnel -- large numbers (more than 20) of humans
and humanoids -- possibly pirates.<p /><em>[So let's

feel its warmth reaching the cold inner reaches of her
stomach and spreading throughout her body from there.
Warm food on a rainy, cold day was one of life's most
enjoyable and simple pleasures.<p />The tales of an
underground ocean intrigued her. Could this be an ideal spot
for this bounty to hide? Could it be used as a base
of operations for an entire network? Perhaps the
people were frightened of the place for reasons that
were perpetuated by the cunning adversaries.
<p />It seemed that the women in the group had done all
that they could, while Dijani had been eating, for
their fallen friend. She wondered if there was
somewhere nearby where a person of magicks or healing could
be found.<p />But first she needed some answers.
Still, it looked as if the poor bloke mightn't last much

are not affiliated with the Nightshade Gang<br />* They
expect the ship to have raised anchor and sailed off
after the attack by your group<br />* They know nothing
of the tunnels except that the one they were to take
would lead them to the hamlet's underground sector,
where a ladder would lead them to the Wizard<p />The
interrogation was aided by drugged wine, and subtle magicks
cast by Lady Silkervish.<p />"Well Elise, we have

inquires, the blood and gore barely noticable against the

The interrogation was aided by drugged wine, and
subtle magicks cast by Lady Silkervish.<br /> Well I
suppose that's be a more refined approach than offering
to squeeze the family jewels.
<em>;) .oO(I can't believe
   I just said that...)</em>
<p /> "Well Elise, we have
nearly exhausted our arcane strength, as well as our
supplies. What course of action do you propose?", the Lady
inquires, the blood and gore barely noticable against the
black lace and leather.<p /> "This is quickly
becoming more complicated than I expected." Elise says, a
hint of irritation in her tone.<br /> "Perhaps we should
make our way to the town to rest and plan our next
move."

<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />
-=[Elise]=-<p />The group consolidates its
remaining resources, bandages its wounded, and heads back
to the intersection, guarded by the undead
ogre.<p />Sending the Skels ahead as scouts, and retaining the
zombie-ogre as rear guard, the group takes the NE tunnel
toward the hamlet. The pirates indicated that that was
the one they'd have taken, based on their
orders.<p />Some distance later (hundreds of yards), sounds of
fighting become quite evident.<br />Bricks and light masonry
have spilled into the tunnelway, and Elise catches the
scent of gremlins.<p />The skels investigate the
aperture in the tunnel wall, and Lady Silkervish --
holding the very bridge of her nose, while her eyes are
shut -- relates that they see more than five, but less
than ten humans in a small room, perhaps a cellar,
fighting with gremlins.<p />Escemine and Silthis
cautiously advance to within a few yards, then quickly
return.<p />"Commoners and a gallant woman are embroiled in a fight with
two or three gremlins. The confines are such that the
little cusses have the advantage, I'd say.", Escemine
informs the group.<p />"I say we press on, and reach
the ladder to Bjolfe's...home.", Silkervish suggests,
dabbing at a trickle of blood oozing from her
nostrils.<p />Larshes'ke looks coolly at her with her one eye, then, "I
disagree. They likely know the lay of the land, as it were,
and if nothing else, they are more fodder to suffer
on this accursed trip than our ranks."<p />There
is a quiet tension, but the Orc breaks it, "I agree
with Larshes'ke. Escemine? Silthis? Elise? ...
Kellis?"<p />Everyone but Lady Silkervish is looking at Elise for her
vote. The Lady seems ill-disposed at the moment. Kellis
is impassive, and slouching, though still standing,
his rapier and main gauche at the ready.<p />With
the Black Clad Archer still loose -- a confederate of
Bjolfe and Trask -- the direct method of knocking on the
wizard's cellar door may prove...delicate, to say the
least.<p />"MwreOOOW! Hthsssss!"<br />"Little bastar-- Oh bugbears! Come
here you little
wretch!"<br />"ReaOW-hchshshs-Wreaowll!!!"<br />"Agh!"<p />...and more come
from the partly collapsed cellar
wall.<p />*** What is Elise's vote? Her course of action? ***

-=[Elise]=-<p />Standing next to the skels,
Elise peers into the darkness, and sees the scene for
herself.<p />A tall woman (though not taller than Elise)
weilding an impressive shortsword is embroiled in a battle
with two -- now ragged, and bloddied -- GREMLINS. The
woman is obviously a capable delver-type of some sort,
and she is somewhat aided by the commoners who are
using makeshift weapons.<p />The rough opening was
bashed-out from their side, and will require one Round for
Elise to navigate, due to her full plate armor, and
longish weapons.<p />[rolling some dice...] no one
seems to notice Elise or the skels.

Seeing the dark figure didn't lift Dijani's
spirits any. If this was a friend, then there was cause
to be happy; if this was a foe, then they were done
for. She could not fight the gremlins and this
experienced warrior by herself, and the people about her were
little or no help. "I might as well assume that this one
is friendly, and break the ice." Dijani
thought.<p />"I sincerely hope that you're no friend of gremlins,
stranger!" Dijani said loudly, "umph"-ing as she struggled
in battle with the gremlins. <p />[3d6=10
