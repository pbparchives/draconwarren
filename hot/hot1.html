Royal Proclamation<br />Her Empress, the Death
Goddes of Khazan, through her appointed
representative, the Baron of Khole, has issued a 7,000 GP reward
for the live capture of Spurlious Trask, infamous
ring leader of the Nightshade Gang, and a 500 GP
reward for the primary hand of each gang
member.<p />These cowardly miscreants have vandalized the magickal
mural of our Empress located on the outer, west wall of
the Styxtrene Temple in the heart of
Khole.<p />Devoted citizens of the beneficient Empress who wish to
prove their loyalty should report to the Temple
Autorities for additional information, and generous
provisions provided for the mission.<p />That is
all.<br />Have a nice day.

The worm-eaten beams and pillars of the abandoned
quarter seem like carved pannels as the early sunlight
streams through the organic patterns etched by the slow
creep of the ravenous creatures which taste all who
come into the world.<p />The fettid gutters,
swilling with tidal wash and the refuse of the old, but
small city mix terribly with the greasy and full aroma
of snail-sausages roasting on the open coals across
from the Styxtrene Temple.<p />There, at the Rat on
a Stick stand, an enterprising and somewhat
atractive woman has a long line waiting to receive
break-fast.<p />As you near, you can see that several different
items are for sale: Rat Chunks in Sewer Sauce;
timbermen's cakes w. sap; and some sort of deep-fried potato
cakes.<p />Her customers are as varied as orc businessmen with
their tradesman's bags in hand, occasionally checking
the water clock in the center of town, just a few
dozen yards away; Schwartzalven mothers trying to
retain control of their inky broods; and the occasional
pick-pocket 'earning' his or her meal in line.<p />There
is no sign of any other adventerous/'loyal' souls at
the Temple, and the scaffolds which are dangling next
to the now-draped mural are unattended -- the
workers sitting on the cobblestones eating their meals,
and drinking their steaming chickory-brew.<p />The
Styxtrene Temple, a converted temple of a long-forgotten
demi-god, is as run down as everything else in this
quarter.<p />A lone acolyte, a bald headed, depressed-looking
young man, sits near the head of the bird dropping
decorated stairs, propping-up his head with his fists which
rest on his knees.<br />He is dressed in silver trimmed
blackish robes, and wears sandals upon his feet.<p />He
looks up at your approach, and his eyes begin to widen,
the gloom of his countenance
fading.<p />"Ah...Loyal subjects of the Empress, come, come in, wev'e
been waiting for you..."

*POOF* Throst the
dwarven sorceror comes out of his invisiblity spell. He
looks incredibly smart and powerful, but the smartest
minds are always way way out there...but Throst is way
way out there.<p />"Hello bald one. I am suprized
you knew I was coming." *ZAP* He points his finger at
the bald man and now he has hair, much of it on his
head; and well he also 'accidently' increased his
armpit hair growth. "There ye go, *EGH* ye got some grog
for a chap's work?" he ajusts his spectacles which
have a wierd tint which change countinually.

<span class="t1">THREAD 1: Throst</span><br />

The acolyte gestures for you to follow him in to
the temple.<p />Your keen dwarven nose detects
more than a hint of gold within the dimly lit
interior, incense overflowing as he opens the left pannel
of a double door, which still shows sign of old
battering -- apparently from smaller axe blades.<p />"I
had hoped that your group would be larger...", the
man hesitates looking at you with a faint, nervous
smile.<p />"Follow me, please, sir.", He says as he begins to
dissaper into the darkness.<p />As you follow, you
begin to understand the layout of the temple's
construction, due to your inherent dwarven abilities -- and,
perhaps more importantly, sense that you are nearing a
large concentration of worked gold.<p />"Daergesh,
have we any other takers?", a smoothe, woman's voice
asks from the room. Daergesh -- the acolyte -- is
leading you to.<p />"Yes, my lady. A stout dwarf, and
capable, it appears--", Daergesh begins, but is cut
short.<p />"Your opinion is hardly based on experience. I won't be
needing it. You are dismissed to your pressing duties,
Daergesh.", the same voice, now slightly harsher.<p />You
are shown in, by the now subserviant and shamed
Daergesh, who immediately leaves, further down the dark,
perfumed hallway.<p />The room you are at the threshold
of is a smallish affair, perhaps ten by eight, with
a ten foot ceiling. It is covered in black laqured
wood, intricately carven with human figures and lurking
creatures which almost seem to ooze along as light plays
across its surface.<p />There is a massive desk,
which takes up most of the floor space. It too is made
of black laqured wood, but of a more spectacular
design -- including wildly raised projections from the
legs, and decorated with images of the Death Empress on
her various victories both on the surface world, as
well as in nightmarish underworld scenes.<p />Your
mouth nearly agape at the craftsmanship, you slowly
raise your eys to peer over the top, to the woman
sitting behind the desk.<p />She is a purple-skinned
woman, somewhat elven looking, though clearly a
halfbreen of some sort -- likely schwarzalven and human.
She is possessed of such similar features to the
Empress herself that you feel uneasy in her
presnce.<p />"Ah, a dawrven magician, I see...", she says, smiling
wickedly.<p />"Would you care for some wine this morning?", she
offers, standing slightly from her seated position,
leaning over the immaculate desk's surface, her ample
boosom and spidry waist accented by a black lace and
leather dress, decorated with dangling silver orniments
of agonized-looking skulls of many types of
creatures -- some of which you can not readily
identify.<p />"Lady Silkervish re'Hakt, Priestess in Her service."
Again, her wicked smile, flashing snow-white teeth,
sends a chill down your spine.  "Please, have a
seat."<p />A slight creak to your left causes you to turn, and
you see a form writhing in the wall panneling begin
to separate itself...

<em>
Throst, thanks for replying.<p />I think we
can dispense with the formalities for now. 'Mebbey if
we get some other serious takers it will become
necessary, but for now, let's just go with the narritive and
reply, if that's okay?<p />As far as the general
gamish stuff, I figure low-level characters would be
best, so let's say that your dwarven wizard is at about
2nd/3rd level.<br />Spells are not limited to the book, but
I would like to introduce the new ones -- to keep
the campiness to a minimum, if everyone can groove
with that.<p />You don't need to list any
equipment, or spells, we'll play it off the cuff. Besides,
the priestess will apparently provide specific gear
for the mission that she deems necessary.<p />If
others are interested in a relatively serious game, they
[you] are welcome to join in as adventurers who have
already answered the summons, and are waiting in the
wings -- as it were.<p />Looking forward to
it...<p />-Shrsholn</em>

The magicks you
detect allow you to relax a bit, as a chair separates
from the wall, and trots over to you, lowering to
accomodate your shorter size.<p />The chair is made of
the same wood, and is at least as ornate as the wall,
and nearly approaching the detail of the creepy
desk. It has both wolfish and hawkish characteristics, and
seems to be magickally endowed with a sort of life and
sentience, and a slight undertone of palpable evil emminates
from it, as does everything in the room -- most of
all, Lady Silkervish herself.<p />It stops behind
your legs, and seats you on itself, then slowly trots
closer to the ominous desk.<p />"The seven thousand
gold pieces is for the LIVE capture of Spurlious
Trask. You do understand that, don't you my dear?", she
glowers slightly, then, biting her lip a bit, she
continues, "I'm not really all that interested in his gang. You
should make sure that the leader is the focus of your
search."<p />Now standing fully, you can see that she has an
ornate scimitar strapped to her left on a curious
looking leather belt. The weapon and its scabbard are
clearly magickal as well, and you need not expend much
concentration to determine that the enchantment is not a
pleasant one.<p />"I will provide you with an enchanted
weapon of your request -- within your martial ability --
as well as three scrolls, two potions, and one
lantern. These are yours to use in the furtherance of the
mission, and are not to be disposed of under ANY
circumstance." The Lady's look assures you that she means dealy
business on this point.<p />"I have already received
other guests. Will you follow me,
please?"<p />Turning her back to you, you see that her dress is very
low cut in back, showing off her toned muscles and
sleek figure.  However, the tattoo of the Empress is
far more attention-getting to you, as it is also
clearly of great magickal power.<p />The Lady raises
her left hand away from her body, and above her
shoulder, and with a quick flick of her wrist, you hear
another, long creak from the wall she is now
facing.<p />From beyond the threshold, you can hear a few muted
voices -- normal kindred, speaking in the common tongue.
From this dark room too emmanates groos volumes of
thick, heady smoke of rare inscense.<p />Looking
back, smiling over her left shoulder at you, Silkervish
asks, "and how shall I introduce you to the others?"

The low volume of the other guests Lady
Silkervish has received comes to dead stop as they see her
accompanied by a rare dwarven wizard of your obvious skill
and power.<p />"Darling, while I do appreciate
your social grace, unusual for your kin, I must ask
you to refrain from kissing my hand in the future. I
have too little time to quell any rumors of our --
liason...", she says, smiling genuinely.<p />The chamber
you find yourself in now is lit by oil lamps which
flicker with purplish-blue ghost light, like tormented
souls too weary to escape their confines.  Large
pillows are scattered about the floor, also decorated
with rare carpets from Tiern.<br />water pipes, fuming
silvery smoke bubble throughout the easily twenty by
twenty foot room.<p />Other miscreants, rogues, and
cut-throats -- loyal servants of Lerotra'hh -- who likewise
have answered the summons look at you with varying
expressions.  None of them are as flamboyant or dazling in their
manner as you, but then, who is?<p />A comely
hobbitess, dressed in weather worn, skin-tight leather, and
armed with two sax, and a self-bow is immediately to
your right. She smiles, and offers you a seat next to
her on a fluffy violet pillow trimmed in gold
brocade.<p />Lady Silkervish peers around the now silent
room.  "My friends, we are joined now by the Wizard Throst.
I know that you will extend your full cooperation
in your dealings with him, as I have asked of each
of you in turn as we have met new
members."<p />The others nod at you, and some servants approach,
offering rare delights on platinum platters.<p />After
a moment, you find seating to your satisfaction,
and are able to engage in chit-chat for a bit before
the Lady speaks again of the
mission.<p />

'Silk' continues to chime away as the lot of you
continue through the lybrinthine temple, your nose all the
while noting the scent of worked gold, though, as of
yet, you yet to see any except on the box which held
'him'.<p />Naridd Desh, steps nearer to you as you all are walking,
and says, "If you will, sir, please tell me what clan
you belong to. I have traveled far and wide, and have
never met a dwarf quite as sophisticated." He seems
solid enough a warrior, and his battle-worn appearance
adds credibility to his claims of
experience.<p />Meanwhile, as you two are speaking briefly, you hear the
hobbitess speaking to Silthis the Fleet. You manage to
catch the pretty one's name, 'Escemine', but little
else is audiable over the light conversation carried
on among the group.<p />Lady Silkervish leads the
group down a hall which bends to the left by at least
30* every forty-five feet or so. At the same time,
you are aware of a slight slope to the
passageway.<p />Vrok Talinn, has joined in the conversation, and asks
you, "You say that you can forge another -- and a
better weapon...", he snorts, but is smiling, then shift
the weight of the weapon in his left hand, the twin
heads glinting in the soft light of a torch on a sconce
nearby. "I very much doubt that, though it's no slight
against you my dwarven friend. I have never seen its
equal, and it needs no further enchantments -- having
been cooled in the blood of an acient mountain
troll," he says, smiling broadly.<p />Scrutinizing the
handle again, you do notice a few Trollish runes among
other you can not easily identify.<p />The group
stops at a large pair of bronze doors, which open at
Lady Silkervish' command, "Tsokshraelleh!"<p />The
massive barracades, easily eight inches thick, and
obviously solid, swing open on greased bearings, then boom
against the rough hewn walls of a grotto.<p />The
others slowly file in, while Silkervish remains at the
portal, then follows you and Vrok inside.<p />The
grotto is expansive, its full extend obscurred by mists
and darkness.<br />Cave animals such as blind
scorpions, and vessher moths dart for cover at the group's
approach.<p />"Keep to your left, there is a dock a few yards beyond
the next turn", the Lady announces, moving past you,
toward the head of the group, lead by Mavin, who has
'its' hand on a sheathed blade longer than many
daggers, but narrower than a
shortsword.

Lighting is provided by
natural phosphorouscence, seemingly oozing from the
obsidian-like rock face. This light is dim, and cool, and it
swims on the surface of the water like stars of doom in
the final night's sky.<p />Lady Silkervish has
passed Mavin, and seemingly steps out onto the water. It
is only as you approach that you can see the planks,
barely above the surface, stretching out into the inky
darkness.<p />Mutterings from the group neatly echo in the cave, as does
the lapping of the waves over the dock. Continuing,
you begin to see the lead elements of the group step
up and away from the direction of the dock, on what
must be a craft of some sort.<p />By the time you
are near enough to make it out, you realize that the
craft is a Khazani War Skiff, complete with ram's head
prow, and the Imperial seal of Lerotra'hh on its
already raised square sail.<br />It easily accomodates the
whole party, and unexpectidly, seems to house a few
attendants as well.<p />To everyone's surprise, save Lady
Silkervish, and Larshes'ke, the attendants are black lacqured
skeletons, wearing suits of chain, and carrying similar
scimitars to the Lady's, though less ornate.<p />"Set us
off." She commands the undead bosun, who bows sharply,
then silently barks orders to the others, who
weigh-anchor, and the like in preparation.<p />"After we
have travelled to our next destination, I shall be
returning with the skiff. Your quarry are nearer to us now
than when we were on the surface, and so I lead you to
their last trace," she says, smoothing the fabric of
her dress as she sits upon a throne-like chair facing
aft.
<p />
"Where in the glooms are you taking us, Lady
Silkervish?" Vrok asks, clearly uneasy.<p />Looking about
you, only Larshes'ke seems unaffected by the
surroundings.<p />There is a long pause, while the Lady sips a skull
goblet, crimson wine dappling her beautiful, black lips,
then, "The Glooms indeed..."

Throst looks for a place to sit closest to
Silkervish as he can. he makes it seem as though he is
drooling at her inside, which he partially is, but he is
more importantly watching her to make sure she doesn't
betray them for one reason or another. He doesn't
believe things could be this close to perfect. (on a boat
in a dark cavern and nothing has
happened...)<p /><br />--Throst

Occasionally, you sense either the Lady, or
Larshes'ke watching you, but upon investigating, neither
seems to be acting odd.<p />It must simply be the
waves of evil rolling off Silkervish, after all, which
set you at un-ease.<p />Similarly, the group,
seems disturbed by the oppressive atmosphere, and long,
silent journey.<br />Vrok and Neridd in particular often
look across at each other, as if silently planning a
course of action, should the need arise.<p />The
skiff continues on, the sail lazily moving with the
often stiff draft which rolls off the glassy
walls.<br />The water's surface, like shimmering heatwaves,
scintillates under the dim light, the wake of the boat
rippling off into seeming infinite night.

though I do like to know if ppl are evil or not would
like to point out that Throst is more on the evil
side than the good. my post in a few days that will

aww crap. first I cast
'DETECT MAGIC' in a secretive manner so that no one
notices. then after that I go and sit next to Silkerfish.
"This gloom you spoke of, what shall our objective be
once we arrive?" If Throst falls asleep we makes sure
he positions himself so that he falls onto
ladysilverfishes' lap if he does. that way if she gets up I will
most likely wake up.<p />--Throst

I had been staying back and observing, because I prefer the

getting others though, and this post suggests to me that
you are going with a more structured game. If so, and
you still are accepting people, I’d like to
join.<p />

I disagree with that.<p />All

them to commit their crimes.
