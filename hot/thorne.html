Background/Personality:<br />
<br />
Thorne is somewhat slight, tall and fair, but hides his light: he dresses in
dark, almost sooty brown; prefers a hooded cloak but cinches the cloak at the
waist. He wears no ornament. (He probably has none.) He's citified, as elves
go. It's a little hard to picture him cavorting in any glades. He's friendly
enough in a quiet way; he's given to a thin smile. He calls the stinks and
sweats of Khazan home more than the forests of his kindred, and speaks little
of his past. He's cut himself from it, and is bent on carving a way for
himself. He's as comfortable with orc as he is with elf. Lately, frankly,
he's been thieving, and is trying to decide whether the call for the hands of
thieves is an opportunity to go straight, or to cut down on competition.
He'll wait and see.
