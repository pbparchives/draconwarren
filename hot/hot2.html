<h3>2799 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 0:13am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

[Elise Ironheart's intro]<p />A week ago, you
caught rumor that Lady Silkervish, with the aid of the
Baron of Khole, under the aegis of Lerotra'hh, Death
Goddess, and Empress of Khazan had begun to hire
professional bounty hunters and assassins to secure the live
capture of Spurlious Trask, infamous ringleader of the
Nightshade Gang, after he had outrageously defied all order
and semblance of civilization, masterminded the theft
of certain powerful magickal items from the palace
in Khazan.<p />He is to be captured alive for the
purpose of being thrown into the Arena, and subsequently
punished by trial of arms.<p />When his disappearance
from the gang became obvious, members of the
Nightshade Gang, apparently acting on their own initiative,
vandalized the mural of the Empress in Khole, Lady
Silkervish, a priestess in the Cult of the Death Goddess, had
been laid to task with their punnishment, as well as
to attempt to produce Trask.<p />Since that time,
you, Elise Ironheart, have answered the offer, and
have been paid 700 GP (10%) as retainer, to undertake
the job of recovering Spurlious Trask --
alive.<p />From Laerst on the river Pyan, you traveled down
stream to Khole, where you met with Lady Silkervish, and
received the retainer fee, as well as the most current
intelligence regarding Trak's last whereabouts.<br />The route
you chose to take was above ground, to a region
outside of Khole proper, where Trask is rumored to
retreat to when the Imperial hounds are too close behind
him. But nothing came of this locale, after an exhaustive
search.<p />Two days ago, you met a wandering bard, Kellis of
Sael, who is a useful source of local information,
news, and gossip.<p />Traveling with him, you have
picked up the trail once again, and have tracked Trask
to a small and anonymous hamlet in the Vaagarth
foothills.<p />Spying out the villiage from a safe distance, the two of
you have positively identified
Trask.<p />Yesterday, rains rolled in, and have slightly impeaded your
recovery attempt, because he has not left the home of the
local hedge-wizard.<p />Today, the rains
intensified, and your companion, Kellis, warns of a powerful
storm.<br />You know that Bojfe Shul, though an outcast of the
Guild, is still too powerful to confront directly. With
Spurlious Trask taking refuge with him, your job has mired
down.<p />Cold, wet, and under provisioned for an extended wait,
you are forced to decide a course of action, or lose
the quarry, and gain the disfavor of Lerotra'hh --
something you lose sleep over!<p />As the moons come to
crown the cloud filled night sky, you begin to sense
that Trask may not even be in the house of the mage at
all, as a forraging run blessed you with the discovery
of a cave and subsequent tunnel leading into town....

<blockquote>Today, the rains intensified, and your companion,
   Kellis, warns of a powerful storm.</blockquote>

Elise looks at
the bard impassively. "If you are afraid of a little
wind and water, go home. I do not leave without my
bounty."

<blockquote>As the moons come to crown the cloud filled night
sky, you begin to sense that Trask may not even be in
the house of the mage at all, as a forraging run
blessed you with the discovery of a cave and subsequent
tunnel leading into town...</blockquote>

Elise takes a close
look at the ground in front of the cave, looking for
any signs of tracks or passage....

<hr />

<h3>2802 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 1:45am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

You sniff at the entrance, and crouch to peer at
the grass and weeds in front of the cave, and detect
enough of a scent to spur you on.<p />"We are going
in, then?" Kellis, says, smiling. "I'll have to ready
a torch, then..."<p />Your deadpan expression,
and flicking tail inform him that you have little
patience for his humor. Still smiling, readies two
torches.<br />"That's what I like about you...you are so talkative..."
he jokes, as he motions for you to enter
first.<p />Ten minutes into the tunnel, and you come to a
northerly, slightly upward sloping branch; as well as the
continued tunnel in the direction of town.<p />"Shall I
flip a coin?", Kellis offers?

<h3>2803 - mistwalker_ - Thu Aug 30, 2001 1:58am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

"Do as you wish. But do so quietly." She says in
a low, harsh whisper. "If he came this way, he went
down one of them. The town would be the easy choice."
<p /> She starts sniffing into the upward slope,
carefully listening and looking for any scratches or wet
footprints...any sign that somethings been up it within the last
hour or 2.<p /> "The easy, obvious choice. The one any
simpleton would take."

<hr />

<h3>2804 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 2:03am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

"Oh, I'm with you.", Kellis reassures
you.<br />Then, motioning that he'll button-up his lips, he waits
for you to decide the course.<p />You proceed a
bit further along both, before returning to the
fork.<p />You are sure Trask and at least a few other
creatures, possibly gremlins, have passed both ways as
recently as an hour ago, though there is little in the way
of hard evidence, only unmistakable scents...

<hr />

<h3>2805 - mistwalker_ - Thu Aug 30, 2001 2:27am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

Elise tries to single out the human spore, trying
to determine which way it went last. If If she can't
determine which tunnel he went through last she'll hazard a
guess and go through the upward sloping one.

<hr />

<h3>2806 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 2:45am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />
   
You do indeed narrow the spoor to a human as
being the most recent, and it leads
upward.<p />Kellis, draws his rapier, and looking at you, offers to
go second.<p />The climb is gradual, and must
take you further into the hills surrounding the
hamlet.<p />As you travel, you are certain that you can hear
activity further along this tunnel. Signalling Kellis, you
two press against the walls, and begin to smother one
torch.

<hr />

<h3>2807 - mistwalker_ - Thu Aug 30, 2001 2:54am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

Elise quietly slips her mancatcher off her
shoulder, then takes a small vial out of her pack and rubs
a small portion of the liquid onto it's prongs.
"There may be many to kill. But death comes to us all,
eventually." she whispers, looking up the tunnel.<p /> "Be
ready to fight. Or be ready to die."<p /> Slipping the
snap-jawed polearm back over her back, she draws her twin
broadswords and advances, slowly and quietly creeping
onwards.

<hr />

<h3>2808 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 3:08am</h3>
<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

[beginning of 1st turn]<p />From no more than
thirty or so yards ahead, yo can make out the footfall
of a humanoid of some sort. You look to Kellis, who
has produced a can to further cover the
light.<p />"You see something?", you hear from that
direction, then silence...

<hr />

Elise bellows out "TORCH!" and charges forward,
trying to bowl over whoever's ahead!

<em>Super, Shrsholn, Cher took her 2nd level Luck
bonus, like most good delvers (unlike Jax, who didn't
know any better at the time).<p />To clear things
up a bit, I run the Orc Jax, the Centaur Chereva and
the Leprechaun Paddy here. I also archive several RPG
adventures at the BFT and other clubs on my pbparchives
site, so some have called me Ishma---er, the Archivist,
yeah that's the ticket. Shrsholn, if you would like me
to archive this adventure too, I'll gladly step up
to the challenge.<p />Some history: I thought it
would be useful, way back when I was running Jax and
Chereva in 2 adventures here simultaneously, to have
separate IDs for them, and I didn't explicitly come out
and state this (sneaky bastard that I am), though I
imagine it would have been obvious to the casual eye of
the naked observer, especially when jaxdracon posted
several of Cher's moves, and when Cher started using
Yithian expletives (e.g., Frak, Fewmets,
etc).<p />These are my ONLY personas at the BFT---yes, it is
true: I am not <a
   href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/tarandracon">tarandracon</a>!
But I AM the more handsome
Orc, despite what he says.... :P<p />So, Shrsholn,
depending on how lazy I feel, and if you'll have her in
your adventure, I may post for Chereva under
<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/jaxdracon">jaxdracon</a>.
<p />But no matter how lazy I feel, nor how much I respect
eickeric, I will never be, nor can I ever approach being an
aspect, flavor, alter-ego, imago, etc. ad nauseam, of our
one and only Ken St. Andre.<p />But I am a huge
fan! Does that count?<p />-Jax</em>

<h3>2813 - Shrsholn - Thu Aug 30, 2001 1:51pm</h3>

<em>
Thanks for the clarifications.<br />They have
dispelled my confusion.<p />Chereva is welcome in the
game, and I will post her modified version,
asap.<p />Regarding the archiving: I'm grabbing my posts in one file,
and the players' in another, so perhaps we can
compare the two at chapter breaks -- provided the game
runs for that long. Thanks for offering.
:-)<p />We've all been infused with the Great Master Gamer, to
some degree, and as he continues to grace us with his
presence here in the BFT, we are that much more enriched.
I bow to your Ken nature...<p />Thanks again for
the help, the interest, and the
clarification.<p />Looking forward to gaming with you.<p />-Shrsholn</em>

very dark purple uniforms, perhaps even armor, fleeing

than a thousand lanterns.<p />The searing heat catches
you in the right shoulder, and you feel its arcane

dissapated by your expert maneuvering.<p />"Whoa!", is
all that Kellis manages before you swing your blade

others, further down the still climbing and twisting
tunnel, seem to be in full retreat, especially so after
the loss of their companion.<p />"Stay where you

his rapier tip pressing into the foe's

the next in line, then they all drop out of sight as
they enter a large, damp area of the cavern.

some manner of distinction between the various story
lines, as I certainly do not want to have another
incident like that which claimed poor Throst.<p />Nor do I
wish to seem overly harsh -- which it appears that I
have -- and uninviting as a GM -- again, the words un-

desire: to run a serious T&T game that hopefully not only
does not discourage, but rather, fills the player's

any other means for reconciliation, which I may

that was theology?? saying "oh we should pray for him"

didn't make those comments on what you called your

contraversial club. if you post a bible qoute your gonna get
something back. Let me point out that you were the first
one to bring up theology. So you need to just realize
that out of 100 ppl SOMEONE is going to give U a bunch
of post back. no one else was bothered by it. And
yes as of now i'll stop talking about it lest teh

therefore I can post whatever I want considering that it is

Split, since you will be responsible for rolling
the initial 3d6 for the eight prime abilities,
without the listed kindred multipliers, since I don't use
them, I don't see a possibility of you being
'jacked.'<p />All the kindred have their multipliers turned into
flat modifiers with the system I use, so any one
character of that given kindred would only range as much as
the initial 3d6 rolls allowed.<br />(03-18 +/-
modifiers)<p />Cool?

"Hmmm.....next time questions first."<p /> Elise
quickly wipes her blade on the dead mans tunic, then rips
it off, snatches up the severed hand and wraps it up
in the cloth.<p /> "A hot spring, yes. Most likely.
We go in as deep as need be, but carefully. They are
one less, but they know we come."<p /> She walks by
him, stopping just after she passes and glances back
over her shoulder. "You knew what I was hunting. Did
you expect me to ask them to please surrender?" she
asks dispassionately. "Bring the torches, and mind
where you step."

Elise puts her hand to the bridge of her nose,
and closes her eyes to think.<p />"was it four or
five?"<p />"I'm ready now. I apologize for my -- foolishness back
there...", Kellis offers, as he looks steely and
grim.<p />"I'll have to tell you about the time I fled from a
pack of wolves through the northeastern edge of the
Misty Wood...", Kellis trails off, his voice lowering
as he looks down the way the two of you came in...

Elise glances back down the tunnel, mildly
concerned. If she doesn't see or hear anything unusual
behind her she'll continue on, wary of traps or ambushes
and trying to pick up her quarry's scent again.

One ear cocked to your left, the other to the
right, you hear noises from both sides.<p />Kellis,
hunches down a bit, slowly moving the torch toward the
ground.<p />Both of you with a start involuntarily jerk back, as a
half-dozen scaley cat-like faces peer malliciously at the
pair of you.<p />"My word..." is all that Kellis
manages before two of the creatures leap upon him, biting
and clawing like furies.<p />The others pour
around him, "Graaaazrr!", the leader snarls, as it
brings a blue-stained stiletto to bear on you, hissing
sharply.

"Very clever." Elise says, raising her weapons
and attacking the leader. "But while your lackeys
remove him, I have you all to myself."<p />She attacks
him full force, trying to end this quickly so she can
help the bard. He's proved useful so far, after all.

The small beast seems to understand you, and
begins to look to and fro, just before your first swing
only narrowly misses.<p />"Shearrk!", the creature
growls again, looking as if it will ham-string Kellis,
too busy with now three of the monsters tearing at
him savagely.<p />Your second blow kills another
which had the misfortune of being used as a shield by
the leader.<p />From the direction of the spring,
you hear more panicked voices, and sounds of
thunderous magickal discharges from the cave.<p />It
seems that the hapless thieves are routing from their
brief respite in the bubbling cave, under serious
duress.<p />This doesn't deter the main of the scely cat like
monsters, except the cleverer leader, who takes a blow from
the flat of your blade, sending his stiletto
skittering across the rough and bloody ground.<p />You
can hear the shouts of injured men directly behind
you, and the laughter of a voice dimly familiar to
your recent memory...

.oO(This could be a problem.....)<p /> Elise
presses her advantage quickly, ignoring the leader now
and wading into the little bugs harrying the bard.
This fight needs to end soon, before someone steals
her quarry!<p /> As her blades flash, slicing into her
opponents, she searches her memory for the source of those
voices. Where has she heard them before?
