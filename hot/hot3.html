As some of the Nightshade members literally press
back to back with you, most singed or still burning,
or with the remnants of short arrow shafts
projecting from their torsos, the remaining monsters scatter
back down the tunnel, like squirrels chased by
foxes.<p />Kellis almost unrecognizable from the wounds he's
suffered, is collapsed onto one knee, looking incredulously
at the sweeping melee about to bowl him
over.<p />From further up the tunnel, from the direction of the
cave, you hear, "M'lady Silkervish! We've some company
ahead..."<p />Just then, two black, laccqured skeletons, wearing
silver-black chainmmail, and armed with jet scimitars
slice-down the remaining gangmembers...

Elise glances down at the thugs fallen around
her, wipes her sword on their tunics and says in a
calm, flat tone, "I refund the retainer if I fail to
deliver, Silkervish."<p />She stands there, swords lowered
but still drawn. "Not if my employer desides to take
my quarry from me. If you did not trust me to do the
job, why did you hire me?"

<span class="t2">THREAD 2: Elise</span><br />

The two skeletons look about impassively, slighly
lowering their blades as well.<p />You now hear and
see, a battle-worn and weary looking lot trudging
toward you two. At the rear is a bloody and slightly
dishevled looking Lady Silkervish.<p />A barbarian,
holding a mean looking doble-bladed axe, steps forward,
and asks you, "Is he with you?", gesturing toward the
now unconscious Kellis, crumpled over the corpse of
the first fallen rogue.<p />A heavily wounded,
pale looking woman with a patch on her left eye
staggers in next, followed by an really rough looking orc
holding a blood stained shortsword in his left hand, and
gripping a bloody sack in his right. He regards you
silently, then steps aside for Lady Silkervish.<p />The
Lady is bleeding from both legs, just below the knees,
and her leather and lace dress is torn off at a
compromising level.<p />The dark-elf looks drained, and is
obviously injured.<p />Panting, she simply looks at you,
then surveys the gore spattered tunnel, "Good
timing... Once we salvage what we can from the skiff's
wreckage, we can hole-up here..."<p />The barbarian has
a deep look of disgust on his face as he hears
that, and shaking his head, nudges past you, and
crouching at Kellis, begins to tend to his
wounds.<p />"Scout ahead of us, but fall back at serious
resistance.", Silkervish orders the chief of the two
skelletons.<p />They immediately comply, skittering up the rounded
walls of the tunnel on either side of you, and rushing
past, down the way you came.<p />"Now dear, what
were you saying exactlty?", she says
absently.<p />The orc snorts, crouching by the barbarian, and
produces a polished bone flask decorated with orcish
shamanic runes.<p />"It will heal him very quickly. You
will have to hold him down, as it is very painful", he
says to the barbarian, who begins to pin Kellis's
shoulders to the ground.

[[further back in the cave:<p />Escemine,
and a badly wounded Silthis the Fleet come to shore,
coughing the foul water out of their lungs.<p />"Did
&lt;cough&gt; Neridd or, &lt;ak&gt;, Mavin make it out of the
death fog?" Silthis asks the other, still
sputtering.
<p />
"No. At least I don't think so...and too bad about
that cute dwarf. I've got to return his dagger to his
clan...If I make it out of this damed contract alive...",
Escemine replies, sadly.<p />Silthis, standing shakily
now, and tending to herself as best possible, "C'mon.
Let's see if we can find the others, or what's left of
them."]]

<blockquote>"Is he with you?"</blockquote>
"He is." Elise answers,
paying little attention to the barbarian or anyone else
who enters, save for Silkervish.<br /> "I was saying, I
only refund my retainer if I fail to retrieve my
quarry. A contract is a contract." She says, ignoring the
skeletons as they pass.<br /> "If you do not trust me to do
my job, why did you hire me?"

<hr />

<h3>2864 - Shrsholn - Sat Sep 1, 2001 11:11am</h3>

Looking puzzled, and more than slightly annoyed,
Lady Silkervish replies, "You have faithfully
completed your assignment up to and including these
actions. If you are displeased with my associate's bag of
goodies..." motioning to the orc's bloody bag, "well, I'm
affraid you'll have to take it up with him, my dear. I'm
sure you do remember that you were not the only hunter
hired, no?"<p />Then, drawing nearer to you,
"Besides, I've now been forced to involve myself further --
far further than I had intended -- in the actual
procurement process. You still stand in the best condition to
make good on the capture, as there's hardly a scratch
on you, while, as you can see, we've weathered our
little voyage rather poorly..."<p />Kellis
practically levitates off the ground as his muscles spasm.
His scream is stifled by a wet rag the orc places
firmly in and over his mouth.<p />The attendant orc looks
up briefly at you, letting you know this is all
expected with the curative.<p />The barbarian continues
to hold Kellis down, until his eyes roll up in his
head, and with one last shuddder, he collapses again
into unconsciousness.<p />"Lady Silkervish! I realize
that the trip hardly went as you planned, but this --
blundering has already cost two human lives, not to mention
the loss of your smaller hirelings. When will you
admit that we need field leadership!" shouts the
barbarian, whose name you overheard as Vrok.<p />Peering
down her long, thin nose at him, you feel palpable
evil fill the tunnel.<p />The axe in the northern man's
hand begins to chime slightly, and he stands
menacingly only a few feet from the two of you, boring holes
in the Lady's head with his rage filled
eyes.<p />&lt;"Look, there they are!"&gt; Elise hears from the
direction of the cave.<p />The arrival of a water-logged
hobittess dressed in torn, painted-on brown leather armor;
and a badly wounded fairy-like creature does little
to dissolve the confrontation.<p />"Good of you
two to join us.", Lady Silkervish says dryly.<p />Then
speaking to Elise, though continuing to match the
determined stare of Vrok, "Give us your report, hunter. How
much resistance have you thus far encountered?.."

Elise nods. "Well enough. As long as I get the
pay earned."<p /> She glances at the midgets curiously
through the slits in her helm, her horns gleaming in the
torchlight. Then back down at Kellis, to be sure he still
breathes.<p /> "That one started following me 2 days ago. He is
a bard who has proved useful. I followed the trail
of Spurlious Trask to the home of a finger waggler,
where he spent some time. He snuck out in the rain and
into this cave, where I picked up his scent. I was
giving chase when we were interrupted by some smelly
cat-like creatures, who seem to have some intelligence but
poor tactics.<p />Their leader fled like a whipped
mongrel after losing his knife. Then you showed up. That
is all."

"Gremlins.", the hobbitess offers.<p />You
look down at one of the little bodies you sliced in
two. 'So that's what they were.'<p />"Your friend
will be back to normal in a few hours. Is this the
best shelter we have?", the orc asks you as he stands
up, brushing off his hands on his pants.<p />"Vrok.
Simmer down. We're still breathing, and the others have
joined us now. We'll prevail...", he then offers to the
barbarian.<p />Fury Master Vrok Talinn, axe still in hand, sets his
jaw at an odd angle, as if fighting to keep his mouth
shut, then walks back toward the cave, and the
'wreckage' they spoke of earlier.<p />Lady Silkervish
rolls over a few of the fallen gangmembers. "We should
check them for anything useful." She then crouches over
the nearest, and begins to pat his corpse
down.<p />Escemine walks over to her, and says, "We haven't made an
extensive search for survivors yet. Shouldn't we look for
Throst, Neridd, and Seul?"<p />"You certainly may, dear. Vrok
has already headed in that direction. See if you can
get him to salvage what's useful from the skiff,
won't you?", Silkervish replies dryly as she holds a
small charm necklace from the rogue in her right
hand.<p />Escemine's darling face sours slightly, then, with a hurtful
look in her eys, she says, "Well at least tend to
Silthis, then..."<p />Silkervish regards her cooly, and
looks as if she would snap the liitle-one's neck if it
wouldn't overly complicate things.<p />Then, "Larshes'ke.
Heal the group, won't you dear?"<p />The pale woman
with the eye patch, who seemed to virtually disappear
while the commotion with Vrok had flared up, steps away
from the curved wall -- in plain view the whole time
--, and begins to sigh as she lays her hands on the
fey creature.<p />A shimmering violet aura envelopes
Silthis, and her dragonfly-like wings are restored, and
her coin-sized purple bruises lessen to mere
welts.<p />Then, spent, Larshes'ke, slumps back against the stone
wall, and in a light sweat, reaches for a flask at her
side.<p />One of the Skelletons, its hard to determine which,
returns, slowly, and wordlessly communicates with the
Lady.<p />"There are three branches to the northeast. One seems to
lead toward the hamlet you spoke of, while the others
head off at right angles from each other, due north,
and east. There are gremlins everywhere apparently,
perhaps the wizard has struck some sort of bargain with
them, for they are armed occasionaly...", she pauses,
to investigate the poisoned stiletto abandoned by
the last wave's leader, then continuing, "he says
that there's also sounds of mining, or other industry
from the direction of 'town'."<p />"Help
the...help, her" she points at Elise, "to remove the right
hands of these fallen."<br />Slikervish looks at you in
the most concilliatory manner you think possible for
her icy nature.

Elise shakes her head slowly. "No. They are not
my kills. I lay no claim to their hands."<p /> She
crouches, rifling through the gremlins corpses for anything
of use. "His spore led up this passage. He did not
go to the village, unless there is another way there
from here. He most likely got around you, if you
haven't killed him already. The gremlins no doubt aid
him. Their folly."

take your counsel on the current status of our search,

you, then sitting next to Larshes'ke, who looks a bit
refreshed from the contents of her flask.

"Then this is my councel." Elise says, meeting
Silkervish's gaze.<p /> "Tend to your wounded and yourself. The
gremlins are small, but that may their strength here. They
have some intelligence, they may be many, and if this
cave is their home it may be riddled with traps. If
you intend for us to stay a group against them,
stealth isn't an option."<p /> Her head turns towards the

As Elise enters the last few yards of the tunnel,
she can see the cavernous opening of an underground
river feeding into a spring basin.<br />Steamy sulfurous
air fills the chamber, and many molds and fungi are
growing all about.<p />Throk, Silthis, and Escemine
are hauling bits of wreckage ashore, the barbarioan
in the black, bubbling water.<br />"There's a heavy
chest, I can't quite get it alone...", Throk shouts, the
echo booming several times.<p />Silthis, flying

<em>[Yes]</em><br />You give a mighty pull, and you can see
that Vrok gives it all he's got, and together, you
manage to right it and drag it ashore.<p />It is a
steamer-trunk-sized chest. It is glossy black, perhaps with inlaid
stone, and is bound in bronze and gold.<p />There are two
large bronze rings on either side -- handles -- and it
is hinged, though no lock is obvious on the opposite
face.<p />With its face toward you, you all can see that there
are three recessed buttons inside an elaborate
filigree of gold.<p />"Bloody heavy that was!", Vrok
chimes in.<p />"Is it magickal Silthis?", asks
Escemine.<p />"Oh - y e a h !...its magickal alright...", she
replies.<p />You don't allow your senses to become too focused on

With one bite of his double bladed axe, he slices
through Elise's armor, leaving her to deal with a painful
wound which would down an average human.<br />[<a
   href="elise_ironheart.html">04 hits off CON</a>]<p />However,
her second sword blade
cleaves through his torso just under his arms.<br />He is
quite dead.<p />The axe wound feels like frost-bite,
and steam wafts lazily from the damaged armor on
Elise's left hip.<br />The searing cold continues to
spread, and she finds it difficult to stand.<p />[DEX

<p />The icy feeling spreads further down to Elise's
thigh, and up a bit, to her ribs.<p />Steadying yourself
on the chest, you hear Lady Silkervish muttering
enchantments, and your wound is healed -- and the numbing
effect neutralized.<p />"We need you intact Elise!

She looks towards
the spring, wondering if she'd be able to make it
there before the cold spreads to her vitals, but just
as she starts reaching for her polearm to use as a
crutch she hears Lady Silkervish casting her spell.
<blockquote>
As the warmth returns to her hip she stands upright
again, examining the now vanished wound and the gash in
her armor.

Elise simply nods at the
offer of a reward.<br /> "I do not use axe's. They are
too clumsy."

The next few minutes are spent extracting the
ogre-zombie from the chest Elise carried on her
back.<p />The thing, male, is a hulking creature, and evidently
well preserved by the lack of stench -- only an
earthy, musty smell.<p />Armed with Vrok's charmed
axe, the leather-clad brute adds a strange sense of
security to the operation -- though maneuvering it about
these tunnels may prove its undoing.<p />"We should
prepare to set out when we are recoperated." Silkervish
suggests to the group, which is otherwise silent.

<em>[[OOC]] Ok, I'm confused. I thought Vrok was one
of Silkervish's henchmen. Why would he suddenly try
to kill her when he saw the zombie in the chest? I
thought at first he raised his axe to attack the zombie,
and that Elise was nuts for attacking him. But then I
re-read it and realized he had his axe about Silkervish's
head, so Elise defended her by attacking him. Did Vrok
go nuts? What is going on? What is the airspeed of
an unladen swallow?</em>

<em>[[OOGM]]-Vrok is a might touchy, being
a<br />professional berzerker. He also had a big-time aversion to
undead. He and Neridd were quite uncomfortable with the
skeletons -- they almost packed-up and left. By the time
that the Ogre-zombie was revealed to be the precious
cargo of which Silkervish was so concerned -- and which
nearly got them all killed twice, it was too much.<br />He
was just hired help anyhoo...and good help is hard to
find these days.<p />Hard to swallow: African, or
