-=[Party On!]=-<p />[since some of you folks
are west of the big-miss, I'll refrain from
announcing this season's victorious robot...<p />[Getting
back into the swing of things...]<p />Elise having
gone through three hapless gremlins, and working on
the fourth, determines through interrogation that
Trask is not the Wizard Bjolfe (!), and that the
Scoundrel is with him...somewhere in the
tower.<p />While the scaley cats were expiring under the loving
caress of the MinoElf, Dijani and the Orc were
discussing the options for finding the real
baddies.<p />It seems that the Wizard is quite the disappearing
artist, and the scent of Dritauge's swamp-gas arrows is
not sharp enough to lead on to their where
abouts.<p />Escemine, Silthis, and the recovered Larshes'ke are looking
anxious over the loud noises, near sensings, and generall
dilly-dallying which has consumed roughly an hour and a half
since the party's arrival in the wizard's
tower.<p />Larshes'ke, examining the gremlin leader's stiletto, remarks,
"Mmm...there is a big problem here."<br />Waiting for all ears,
she continues, "One enchantment on this blade is a
scrying link. It allows the scryer to know the
whereabouts of the blade, as well as the state of the holder.
Another is --"<p />But the explosion which tears her
to pieces cuts her warning short.<p />Escemine is
catapaulted across the chamber, blood arcing wildly along her
trajectory.<br />Silthis is no where to be found...<br />The orc is thrown
to the ground, and is bleeding from
shrapnel.<p />Dijani must make a L3 STR SR to remain standing, and
<a href="dijani.html">takes 10 hits before armor</a> -- no fancy armor
maneuvering on this one.<p />Elise must make a L2 STR SR
to remain standing, and takes 11 hits -- which
bounce off her plate armor.<p />The room is filled
with thick, acrid smoke -- A L2 CON SR is needed to
remain breathing functionally (i.e., not coughing your
guts out) this round, and 3 + the amount failed by is
taken this round from the fumes.<p />Through teary,
burning eyes, the survivors see three distortions in the
billowing cloud waver and shift, nearing from the center of
the circular teleport chamber.<p />"So good of you
all to come. Please, don't get up on my account."
says a voice unfamiliar to the group.<p />The
fringe effect of the invisibility wears off, and
Dritauge, Trask, and an older man who can only be Bjolfe
the wizard, are standing a fraction of a second at
arrow-speed from the three of you.<p />"We have no time.
Kill them cleanly, or I'll slag this whole chamber,
and you two worthless dolts with it." Bjolfe says
dispassionately.<p />[tsk-tsk-tsk...]

-=[*]=-<p />Dijani and Elise defiantly remain
standing, both slightly impaired by the noxious fumes
created by the exlposion.<p />Through teary, burning
eyes, the survivors see three distortions in the
billowing cloud waver and shift, nearing from the center of
the circular teleport chamber. Caughing from the
smoke, Dijani and Elise present their best face, though
spasming from the diaphragm causes them both to wince and
shudder.<p />"So good of you all to come. Please, don't trouble
yourself on my account." says a voice unfamiliar to the
group.<p />The fringe effect of the invisibility wears off, and
Dritauge, Trask, and an older man who can only be Bjolfe
the wizard, are standing a fraction of a second at
arrow-speed from the three of you.<p />"We have no time.
Kill them cleanly, or I'll slag this whole chamber,
and you two worthless dolts with it." Bjolfe says
dispassionately.<p />"No. I don't think so." replies Spurlious
Trask.<p />He is a skeletally thin, elfin creature, sharply
dressed in black silken pants, and a grey poet's shirt.
Hip-high eelskin boots accentuate his long legs, and
further exaggerate his lithe form.<br />He is armed with a
sheathed rapier, and a sheathed dagger of some
sort.<br />His angular face is nonetheless boyish, perhaps even
slightly effeminate, kohle decorating his abalone eyes,
and contrasting with his graphite colored skin. Atop
his brow rest eelskin goggles, which disrupt his
spikey silver hair.<p />Dritauge by contrast, is
bearded and moustached, wearing a black silk blindfold,
though he has his bark-covered self-bow in hand -- with
arrow notched. His hands are encrusted with writhing
fighting rings, which gibber and moan.<p />The wizard
Bjolfe, easily in his sixties, simply attired in a dark
grey robe which drapes to the cold stone
floor.<p />"And how is this?", the wizard asks, dazed by the
defiance rather than outraged.<p />"I think not. My
boys deserve something better...for all they've
suffered. Besides old man, you still have no clue as to
where *my* treasures lie." Trask replies, dripping with
arrogance.<p />The orc begins to stand by the two of you.<br />"I
thought you didn't have much time..." he offers, bloody
spittle decorating his lips and jaw.<p />"...Very
well..." replies Bjolfe.<p />The next instant, the
surroundings change in a blur.<p />A similar chamber to the
one in which the party had found itself initially is
filled with arcane cabinets of vials glowing with an
oragneish light, a score of armed Nightshade Gang members
outfitted for an expedition, and an irregularly sided, rune
carved portal large enough to admit two elephants side
by side, which appears to have been excavated from
the familiar looking tunnel rock.<p />"Then I
suppose we will have to bring them with us..." says
Bjolfe, smiling slightly.<p />*** [same bat time, same

Dijani thought it best, given her infirmed state,
to sit back and observe a little. They didn't seem
to be in any immediate danger of death, so
conserving strength seemed the prudent thing to
do.<p />She listened as Elise, personable as ever, spoke to
their captors.<p />"Elise's comments might have
changed all that, however." Dijani mused, and she racked
her brain for a way out of this that didn't require a
lot of strength. The orc looked severely injured, she
knew that she wasn't 100%, and Elise didn't look as if
she were doing that great either, if Dijani could be
any judge of her kind's health status by outward
appearances.<p />"Perhaps I can sneak a few healing spells in under their
noses..." She thought, and realizing that they were
distracted by Elise's spunk, she placed her hand on the orc
and tried just that.<p /><em>[OOC: I'm not sure what
healing magicks Dijani is now aware of after absorbing
the Lady's ESS, so I wasn't sure if I should pick a
healing spell that Dijani already knew, if you'd like to
pick something that she absorbed from the Lady, or if
you could e-mail me an updated list of her knowledge
and wanted me to pick, oh great and wise DM. :D]</em>

Next, Dijani concentrated on healing herself. If
she and the orc were 100%, then they would have a
much better chance when they had to fight their way
out of here. One thing was for sure--the archer was
dead. Of that she would be very sure, even if she had
to sacrifice herself to make sure of it!

Dijani was able to discern the relative strengths of the guards in 
the immediate area as Spurlious Trask and Elise prepared to battle to 
the death.
<p />
Bjolfe had disappeared.<br />
Not good.<br />
He might be invisible, or have teleported away, or gone ghostly.

looked in each other's direction.

Willim Dritauge was wanted dead by the Khazan Internal Intelligence 
Legion (KIIL) for high treason, as well as numerous crimes against 
the Empire and the Empress.

Dijani could feel the slightest bit of grief for the icy witch.

<p />
The sound of shattering steel roused dijani from her meditations.
<p />
Both of Elise's trusty broadswords were now silvery dust glittering 
as they fell to earth.
<p />
One hand outstretched to thrust was countered by Trask's main gauche, 
the blade of which was slowly fading from a reddish glow.
The same fading glow surrounded his rapier which had parried her 
other sword.
<p />
In a terrible instant, Dijani saw his ripost lunge through Elise's 
shattering plate armor, and into the woman.

A look of mild approval crossed Trask's face...

"What do you intend on doing with us?" asked the Orc.
<p />
Bjolfe looks at him in a sidelong glance, then, turning his back on
the two of you, addresses Trask. "Do you intend on wasting any more
precious time? The gateway will only remain open for a little over a
quarter-hour. Not much time for your little games..."
<p />
Trask flicks the blood off his transparent rapier.
"She's Willam's problem. And as for the Orc..." Trask waves his hand
dismissively.
<p />
Willam grunts satisfied, a deep grin washes across his face, the
black silk blind still wrapped tight.
<p />
Whispering, ~"They underestimate us. That may be our only chance..."
the Orc leans closer, nodding in the direction of the 'gateway' from
whence slow-motion, ethereal lightning languidly forks and arcs.
<p /> 
Willam Dritauge speaks up, "Drop the bubble, Wizard. I want the
girl."
<p /> 
Bjolfe turns from giving a gremlin orders.
He looks penetratingly at Dijani, "No. She reminds me too much of my
daughter. ...Need I remind you two oafs what is at stake here?!"
<p />
Both men look at him, each wearing a sour, writhing face.
<p />
The force-bubble containing the two of you is moved forward, through
the gate room's doorway, and the full grandure of the mad wizard's
work can be appreciated.
<p />
A tower-clock sits amid of excavated stone shards. The clock face is
carven with eldritch sigils, and it appears to have more than one
layer, with moving clockwork gears spinning away.
The frame itself appears tome made up of cogs and gears driving
axels, operating auxillary gauges, etc.
<p />
No sound like that which washes in and out of the area has been heard
by Dijani. It is like muted conversations, waves on the shore, and
the flipping of pages all blended into one overlapping tone.
<p />
"Marvelous..." the Orc mutters, awed.
<p />
"Yes. This is how we shall travel to another world..." Bjolfe says,
smiling widely.

Without even really pondering the bizarre nature of her
situation, Dijani thinks that she knows what is going on. Time seems
to be moving, and yet not moving, in this strange place. Somehow,
this wizard was moving through time, using it as his tool to travel,
explore, exploit, and dominate. At least, that was her guess.
<p />
"I remind him of his daughter?" she muttered to the orc with an
incredulous but subtle grin. He was her only known ally in this
insane twist of events. What really amazed her is that he had a
daughter, and if he did, that he could really care for her. It had
long been her opinion that those that harbored evil lost their
abilities to love, so that all that remained of the bonds of love was
a sense of perverse possession. Whatever the case with Bjolfe, she
was glad she reminded him of something that he didn't want to lose,
possession or no.

"I'd investigated him a bit before my mission for the Empress
started, but I'd no idea he had a daughter. Hmm." The Orc confides.
<p />
Dritauge and Trask 'look' at each other, then head in separate
directions. Trask moves toward the gateway, while Dritauge ducks out
of the room.
<p />
An observant Gremlin apparently informs Bjolfe who looks up at Trask,
but doesn't say or act against him, watching instead.
<p />
"This thing nearly ready old man?" Trask asks, bitter restraint thick
in his speech.
<p />
Bjolfe regards him for a moment, gesturing with his left hand, then
saying, "As you well know, we have less than ten minutes as it is.
What is on your mind Trask?" Dijani can sense the activation of a
spell from the Wizard.
<p />
The Orc nearly falls over as the force-sphere fades like a soap
bubble. "Whoa!" he whispers, steadying himself.
<p />
"I'd get ready for trouble..." the Orc looks serious.
<p />
Trask turns, and addressing Bjolfe, produces a small box from up his
sleeve. "I've got something here for you and all your troubles...",
then the Rogue wings the box at Bjolfe.

front of Bjolfe, shielding him as well.

The box detonates against the force wall in an icy silver blast,

insolence!" -- then turning to the two of you...

"Arrest me later, if you must! We must stop Trask before he attempts
to use the gate or we may all be destroyed!"

Dijani nods in agreement. In any case, she had to be alive before she
would get a chance to capture her prey!
<p />
"What should we do?" she queries.

Trask is no where to be seen, aparently overconfident that his dual
blasts of power were enough to finish the unprepared group.
<p />
"We have time enough to either step through and sabotage the machine,
or ... attempt his capture." Bjolfe looks on with tired, sad eyes.
<p />
"Why were you opening the gateway?" the Orc asks of the Wizard.
<p />
"I am looking for someone who disappeared long ago. I lured them to
assist me simply to have the rest of the work done in a speedy
manner. It was my folly..." the disheartened Bjolfe replies.
<p />
A gremlin lieutenant stealthily creeps in. He half-hisses at Dijani,
an ear recently cut off...
He converses with the Wizard in its native tongue, akin to both
Feline and Serpentine.
<p />
"Well, at least my Gremlin allies are still with us..." Bjolfe smiles
grimly.
<p />
"Now, I suppose, it is up to you two to weigh our options. For you
perhaps a simple and clear cut choice -- for me, I have only one
goal."
<p />
"To travel through the gateway..." The Orc observed plainly.
"Dijani, what say you?"
<p />

<em>Hi K--and Jim, you too--our home computer is on the fritz. With
three children (and another on the way!) I can't get out to another

This thread is not dead.
Some promising signs of renewed activity may result in new posting.

That is all...

"I have one question for you." Dijani said, looking at the wizard and
the Orc. "Do you think Trask will also enter?" Dijani asked, intent
upon her goal.
