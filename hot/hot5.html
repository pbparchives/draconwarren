Larshes'ke, and Lady Silkervish.<p />Emerging from the
cave, Elise directs the party's attention to the ridge
overlooking Bjolfe's lab.<br />Dijani too recognizes the ridge,
though she came at it from another direction.<p />The
arcane lightning strokes are falling closer and closer
together.<br />The group can not hear anything but explosions and
crackling electricity.<p />The wind is growing still
around the party, as a waterspout can be seen nearing
the Wizard's tower where the lightning rod is
secured.<br />The hail has stopped as well, and only a light
drizzle of rain is falling.<p />The ground is
treacherous due to the fallen hail, and so going is slower
than everyone would desire.<br />Silthis is perched on
Escemine's shoulder.<p />Dijani has <a href="dijani.html">03 additional ESS

spacey -- unlike normal fatigue.<br />Larshes'ke and Lady
Silkervish look particularly drained, and occasionally, the
Lady stumbles, helped back up by her
kinswoman.<p />The valley is a winter scene lit up by red strobes of
lightning.<br />The tower is now just under one hundred yards
distant.<p />A final, continuous arc of lightning homes in on
the tower at the same moment that the waterspout
comes ashore -- headed directly for the
tower!<p />The Skels and Zombogre fall inert; Silthis falls from
Escemine's shoulder (apparently unconscious); and Larshes'ke
clutches her chest, falling face-first into the
hail.<p />*** What do you two do? ***

some goodies from the Imperial Treasury, through

Nightshade Gang had been responsible for defacing several
murals, etc. of Lero'trahh (the death goddess) recently
throughout the Empire, and a bounty had been put on them
(the primary hand of a member would net 500 GP each --

still smell the archer?" <p /><em>OOC: If he says yes,

out more about our situation."<p /><em>OOC: If he says

Elise only has 1 question. "Where is Trask!"<br />If she doesn't get an answer she likes she'll start snapping fingers until she does.

<em>OOC: She wouldn't shed any tears over it, but
she's really more interested in finding out where her
quarry is. If they give her a satisfactory answer she'll
leave them be. If not, it'll be painful for
them.<br />(No one said bounty hunting was a nice business. But
it is a business, and with Elise it's business
first. =Þ)</em>

Elise grabs the creature by the chin and lifts
him up to eye level, studying his face through
slitted eyes for any sign of deception.<br />"Are you
saying the wizard commands Trask? Or are you saying the
wizard IS Trask?"
