[??] Elementalism R 08: Fire Magicks R09 (Rogan's specialization gains him a
free +01 in that area)<br />
[??] Healing R08<br />
<p />
Rogan knows quite a bit about all the elements, but is especially
well versed in Fire Magicks, for one must know how to balance fire's
hunger with fuels of wood and air, and guard against water's
quenching touch.

( * ) indicates a new spell.<br />
<br />
^&gt; The Wall and Barrier spells all work about the same as the books,<br />
more or less.<br />
<br />
^&gt; Phoenix Glory replaces Mutantis... The character can arrange
Ability Scores as stated, but form is that of an armour-scaled,
flaming, flight-capable Phoenix twice as tall as the character, with
a 3x Height = wingspan. Fire damage is in addition to Adds, and
equals 1d6 per level of the character, plus Fire Magicks Rank (in
this case +09), in melee, or 1/2 that per Round to all within 10' of
the Phoenix Form. Same duration and restrictions as the parent
spell. The armour value is equal to (09) Hits.
