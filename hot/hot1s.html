In the streets....<p />A
bright light occurs. 100 dwarves appear in front of the
church. balista's shoot down the doors and windows.
Aimiskro the Warrior-Wizard in charge of his dwarven clan
points his magnificent mithril axe (smithed by Split's
smithy 'TOM') charges the door. Then a faint blue light
occurs and then the ESA clan is on scene. Jaeden
ESA (<a href="images/Amroth1.jpg">amroth</a>'s twin)
pulls out her hammer and runs up along side
Aimiskro. The elven catapults unleash huge smouldering hot
boulders through the church. Dwarves and elves in unison
demolish the church, taking no prisoners. the ESA's
division of fairies are fling around making sure that no
one escapes alive. The evil church is over with. none
shall ever have to deal with it's god again. after
thier job is done all dissaper the way they came, all
for Aimiskro and Jaeden, who walk into the BFT. order
a round of ale and talk of better way of taking out
the church.

I had seen him around a few times, hades, who'd
forget a face like that.<p />He ordered from <a
   href="images/Lucky.jpg">Lucky</a>,
"Give me what the last guy had." Lucky gave him the
swill off the bar, rung-out from the kerchif tucked
into his apron.<p />"eer ya go mate...", Lucky said,
sliding the frosted mug of 'Spitzner' to the
chap.<p />This bloke then looked wistfully into the swirling
grey-amber brew, and with a sour look, cugged it down to the
dregs. Looking at the bar, he smiled, and set the mug
down and walked off out into the night.<p />I
wandered over to see what amused him, "For a good time,
call Shrsholn".<p />Yeah, it was at my expense, but
hades, he didn't know I'd been there, and seen what he'd
drunk.<p />It got me to thinking, 'life's funny, strangers like
snooker balls colliding on the bumper table where winning
means dropping into a dark hole with all the
others...'.<p />I called Lucky, "Hey Lucky..."<p />"Yeah
Shrsholn?"<p />"Gimmie what the <a href="hot2.html#2838">last
   guy</a> had."<p />"but...-"<p />"Just
give it to me. If he drinks here, I'll drink here
too."<p />My elbows on the bar, and the grey-snail sliding
down my parched throat, I looked out over the other
patrons, rolling their dice, and taking their chances
too...

[[Shipy]] "Thanks Lucky." I glanced to my side
when Lucky spoke to Shrsholn who joined me at the bar.
It was just like me to put my foot in my mouth so
easily. I had always been gifted that way. "Uhm... hi
Shrsholn." I grinned a grin as only a real hobbit
could.<p />"I have a funny one for you Shipy. Some guy come in
here the other day, Big Jack Brass was his name I
think, and he said Lucky, do you know what a hoe-bit is.
Of course I said, yes, their short little guys with
hairy feet. And Jack said no, their a small morsel of a
dismembered prostitute." Lucky burst out laughing.<p />I
grunted a little not amused and pointed to the writing on
the wall behind the bar that read, "...feindishly
bested by K. ST.A who is laughing at you."<p />"Right
Shipy, more work less talk." The one-armed, one-legged,
one-eyed bartender straightened his apron and hobbled
away. His wooden leg making an odd thumping noise as he
walked.<p />I took a sip from my mug and spoke to Shrsholn. "I
was always told the more insignificant you are
cosmically the better chance you have of simply dying in
your sleep."

"Is that why I'm always so dead tired after a
hard night on my back?"<p />He seemed more than a
little embaressed, but hobs are cutest when they
blush.<p />"So, did you hear about the dwarf mobilization coming
into town?", I asked, peering a bit nervously at the
door.<p />&gt;"Rumors", he replied, feigning disinterest.<p />"Yeah,
it seems someone got a dwarven wizard killed around
here, and now his clan is coming into town to punnish
the local Cult of the Death Goddess...hades knows
what for, after all, he'd joined that party hunting
down ole' Trask.", I informed him.<p />There was a
long pause, then, "Is that so?" the hob replied,
looking quite detached. It was probablly what we'd been
drinking, cause it had left a bad taste in my mouth too...

[[Shipy]] "What I don't understand is why
Hobbit's don't ever mobilize? I remember back when a good
banana peel could solve about anything. Now it's just
kill, main, hack, slash and slaughter..... boring. Now
you make one off hand school boy remark and your
gutted like a cheap Throst. Like I said I'm no one's
Hobnobbit, plus I figure the comedy relief always survives."
I chuckled as only a ¾ drunk Hobbit could, casting
a glance up and down Shrsholn slowly, then raising
one eyebrow.... thinking "meow".<p />"At least us
hobbit's have one thing going for us, we can tell the good
guys from the bad guys. Let's see, big, mean, hairy,
bad teeth, foul breath, called Eric, ugly, carrying a
red sword...yup, must be evil... heh heh heh."
<p />"See Shrs.... you don't mind if I call you Shrs do
you?" Shrsholn gave me one of those quizzical glares
that women often give you that you have no idea it
means. "I've adventured before, a lot of times, it's
true. Frell I've even been party leader more times than
Frodo has fingers. They always tell you something like;
The bad news is, only a small party of people can
sneak through. But they never tell you, the good news
is your party is about to get a LOT
smaller."<p />I fumbled in my pocket and then pulled out some
lint and some mints. I never knew when I was going to
get lucky (and I'm not talking that other Lucky
either). "Care for a breathmint?"<p />Shrsholn looked
at the lint and mints in my pudgy hand and shook her
head no. I took one and put it in my mouth, spitting
the lint out.<p />"I do know a thing or two about
cults. See there was the Goblin Cult, then there was the
Blue Oyster Cult. Tell me about this Death Goddess
Cult Shrs." I blinked my eyes a few times. Shrsholn
was getting better looking. I sipped more of my dark
swill, ignoring the bad taste. That was what the
breathmint was really for. To kill the bad taste of the
cheap booze.

"Woah, slow down on the hootch there little
fella, you're getting me all worked up." I said,
wondering where the evening would lead us.<p />He'd been
pounding the swill harder and harder as he'd been
inspecting me.<p />Sure, I wasn't much of a looker, but
after a few strong drinks, just about any kindred found
me appealing.<p />Must be my magnetic
personality.<p />Nah.
<p />"Well, I've heard it rumored that Lerotra'hh, you know,
the ruler of Khazan, -- well, some of her most loyal
sycophants -- that is brown-nosers -- have decided that
since she's so terrible and powerful (and hot, to
boot!), and seeing as no one has yet really defeated her,
well these snots have decided that she actually is
worthy of veneration. They've based their adulation on a
cruel wolf-b of a woman. Bound to go wrong there, eh?",
I offered.<p />"You want to hear about some
really uppity hobbits? Martial artists, equipped with
hand dokyu, and anti-TTYF medallions. Sheesh! They're
harder to get rid of than roaches -- the insects, that
is...", I quipped.<p />The little fellow was wobling
on his seat, so I steadied him. "What's your take on
all the business in the Tavern, 10% off the top? We
should get some organized gambling in here, turn a tidy
profit. Whaddaya say? We can split each night's haul,

[[Shipy]] Yes I was short, curly, sexy and
mysterious, it was a curse of my kind I guess. I was a chick
magnet. And when Shrs let me sit on her lap I asked
myself that age old question that all Hobbits ask
themselves, what would Tolkien do in this situation? Like I
had told myself in the past when the Orc brothers
teased me, just ignore them. Words can't hurt you. Be
strong. It never really worked but it was a good saying
anyhoo. I looked up into Shrs's eyes wondering if she
really knew the power of my neutral side. I could tell
she was impressed by this "hero" business I had told
her about me. It wasn't hard for me to understand
women. I knew what they really wanted. They were all
alike. They wanted someone to do their laundry and
cuddle with them. So I wasn't that good and laundry, one
out of two wasn't bad, plus I didn't like anything
beatin' against a rock including myself.<p />I
gathered my wits about me (what few I still had), smiled
and said. "So Shrs, you want to go upstairs and get
into each other's wardrobes?" I know, I know.... I was
smooth like a Hawaiian Moo Moo.

[[Shipy]] "That's shipy with one p Shrs... never
p twice in the same spot. Uhm er, of course the
store room is well stocked Shrs." I let her lead me
into the store room. Shrsholn was tall, but she was
worth the climb and Hobbits are good climbers, even
drunk Hobbits.<p />I glanced around the bar one last
time, ignoring the dwarf and entered the store room
with Shrsholn. It wasn't like I had anything to worry
about. It wasn't like she was planning anything devious
or anything. Just a good time. The store room was
filled with shelves of goods with a stairs leading down
to the basement. I turned to face Shrsholn and
puckered my lips as only a Hobbit can.<p />

[[Shipy]] I followed Shrsholn outside rubbing her

named Erik' a quick single finger salute when he's not
looking. Damn Samurai's, they were always stealing my
thunder with odd quip's. Who did he think he was...
Amroth? I looked at Shrsholn's butter knife raising one
eye brow as only a Hobbit can. "Better put the pig
sticker away Shrs, you wouldn't want to be arrested now
would you? This reminds of a story Shrs."<p />"Let
me tell you about the hobbit playboy named Jimbob
Huggins, who lived in a fabulous three-story mansion,
feeling bored with his pampered life, so he hires this
wizard Gandalf to find him an exciting adventure.
Gandalf reluctantly tells him about a group of dwarves
who are trying to recover their ancient home from the
evil dragon, Smog (so named because he breathes clouds
of poisonous smoke instead of fire). When Jimbob
happily accepts the adventure, Gandalf is distraught,
knowing that the quest is one of almost certain death,
and Gandalf promised Jimbob's grandfather, Jerry
Took, to look after his wayward descendant. Jimbob
greets the thirteen dwarves, Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili,
Oin, Gloin, Ori, Nori, Dori, Sneezy, Dopey, Doc, and
Thorin, and throws them a big party. Gandalf reveals a
map and key he got from Thorin's father, Grumpy, at a
party the wizard Saruman was holding at his tower,
Barad-dûr."<p />"They next day they set out for the mountain resort and
spa, Riverdale, the last stop before many miles of
untamed wilderness. Before they can reach Riverdale,
however, they are captured one night by three evil trolls,
Tom, Bert and Mike. The trolls decide to cook and eat
the dwarves, but Gandalf throws his voice, making
Mike think the other two trolls are making fun of how
ugly his common-law wife is. This makes the trolls
argue all night until the sun comes up, when the trolls
get stoned, and the dwarves are able to make their
escape."<p />Continued to next post--&gt;

<span class="t0">THREAD 0: Shipy, Shrsholn</span><br />
&lt;--Continued from last post.<p />"After a
weekend stop over in Riverdale, the party crosses over
the Mountains of Myst, but are captured by goblins.
The party escapes, but Jimbob gets separated from the
group and finds himself at the back door of the Mines
of Moria. There he meets the frog-man, Gollum, on
the shore of a vast underground sea. They have a
short joke-swapping competition, and at the end, Gollum
gives Jimbob a magical ring that can make him invisible
as a prize. Jimbob then forces Gollum to show him
the way out of the mountains at sword
point."<p />"Jimbob luckily finds the dwarves and they continue on
their journey, until they reach the house of the evil
werewolf, Björn, who tries to kill them, and he sends his
great pack of wolves out to hunt the dwarves down. They
escape into the dark and magical forest of Mirkwood,
although when they reach safety, they find out that
Gandalf is no longer there. Afraid to go back and look
for him, they continue on."<p />"As they travel
through the forest, they come to a magical river (they
can tell it is magical, because the water is pink.)
Luckily there is a boat on the banks which they can use
to cross, but Dopey decides to swim across instead.
He promptly falls asleep. This really angers the
dwarves, cause Dopey is a fat sack of dead weight, and
they have to haul his ass through the forest for
thirty miles or so before he wakes up. He tells them
about the dreams he had of voluptuous dwarven women,
and the dwarves become even more angry, because they
haven't seen any women for weeks (and they must have been
really desperate to want dwarven women, because dwarven
women are bearded....). They are attacked by giant
spiders, but the dwarves manage to kill the spiders. After
killing the spiders, a group of elves arrest them for
poaching (the spiders were part of a nature reserve, and
elves are rabid environmentalists). The elves take them
back to their king, Thingol, and he locks them in his
dungeons in the elven city of Menegroth."<p />"Jimbob
was not captured, however. He used his magical ring
and eventually freed the dwarves, and they escaped
through the sewers of Menegroth. They built a raft, and
floated down river to the Lake-side town of Escargot.
There they buy supplies and head to Mt. Erebus, the
lair of Smog. Using the map and key of Grumpy, they
find a back door into the mountain, and Jimbob pisses
off Smog by stealing a beer stein from his hoard.
Smog attacks Escargot in revenge, but is slain by the
great warrior, Brad. Brad then marches north with an
army to sue the dwarves for property damage, and
Thingol decides to join him (he really liked those
spiders). Thorin summons his cousin, Dain from the Steel
Mountains, and just as a battle is about to break out,
Gandalf appears unexpectedly, warning them that Björn and
his evil wolves are to attack. The elves, dwarves ,
and humans join together to destroy the evil
shape-shifter, and his bloodthirsty pack of wolves, the Wargs.
In the battle, Thorin is killed, and Dain is
proclaimed king of Erebus. Peace is negotiated between the
three races, and they all live happily ever after.
Jimbob returns to his home in Wickshire, and after a few
years Gandalf and Balin visit him. The book ends as
they happily reminice about the adventures while
smoking Cuban cigars."<p />Shrsholn gives me one of
her famous quizzical looks as if to ask if there was
a point to my story. There was of course.<p />"I
need to buy some more cigars, I'm all out. Anyhoo,
what's the proposition Shrs, and how much clothes do I
have to take off?" I winked at Shrsholn waiting to
hear her proposition. I knew I was probably off base,
but then again all my bases were off.

<p />I've been asking myself that a lot lately, then I
think "Black... black... black... black... pink...
black..." and it all becomes much clearer to me. It is
absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are
either charming or tedious. See, and you thought I was

[[Shipy]] I relaxed on the seat of my favorite
bar stool, glancing around, occasionally sipping from
my mug of grog. "Lucky, let me tell you a story!"
The one armed, one legged, one eyed bartender named
lucky grunted in a gruff unfriendly usual tone and
stared at me with his one good eye as I recounted my
tavern tale.<p />Jax and I were riding in a chariot
down the cobblestone road past some farms outside
Khazan. We passed a cornfield where Taran was in a
rowboat rowing around in the cornfield. <p />After a
second or two Jax turned to me and says, "Shipy, did you
see Taran back there rowing that boat in that
cornfield?" <p />I of course responded, "Yes I did. Let's
go find out why he is doing that." <p />So we
turn around and went back to the cornfield and start
yelling to Taran. I said Jax, "He can't hear us. Maybe
you should go out there and find out why he is doing
that." <p />In a very stern expression Jax says to
me, "What, are you crazy Shipy? You know I can't
swim." <p /><br />"Another day in Khazan...<br />People

Suddenly a pig with three legs jumps on to the
bar and clears his throat, getting the attention of
everyone in the Blue Frog.<p />Shipy thinks he's had
too much to drink. Or not enough.<p />Shrsholn
raises an eyebrow, and kicks Shipy's leg under the table
in attempt to stop his game of footsies.<p />The
one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged bartender named Lucky looks
a bit puzzled, and vows to ask Jack about
it.<p />"As some of you may know we gather here to have all
sorts of fun," begins the pig.<p />Beezer1st notices
the strange glances from the rest of the patrons, and
wonders what's so weird about a talking
pig.<p />"Currently there's talk of a couple of high-falootin'
mid-evil adventures going on around here. But this tavern
is big enough for tall tales about any kind of
adventure, whether it's right here in the Zweets Streets of
Khazan," he snorts, paying his respects to the current
occupying invaders of Khazan, "or adventures in space, or
even private eye exploits of a mercenary
nature."<p />Lucky looks puzzled, and seeing this, the pig points to
the charter on the wall:<p />"The Blue Frog
Tavern: This tavern is assembled to promote discussion
and adventures regarding Tunnels &amp; Trolls, and
related game systems, including, but not quite limited
to: Tunnels &amp; Trolls; Wasteland; Mercenaries, Spies
and Private Eyes; and Starfaring."<p />(In blank
ink, a line has been drawn through the "The" of "The
Blue Frog Tavern".)<p />"Just wanted to remind you.
Ah-beega-beega that's all, folks." The pig jumps off the bar, no
small task for a pig with three legs, and heads back to
his table, a satisfied look on his face.<p />Shipy
sticks out his leg and trips the poor oinkard, and is
summarily carted off to jail for cruelty toward animals.
For having kicked Shipy under the table, Shrsholn is
arrested for the same crime.<p />[we now return you to

Forget trying to pass for normal I told myself.
Follow your Hobbitness. Embrace your Hobbittude. In the
immortal words of Lafcadio Baggins, a Hobbit of incredible
obscurity whose name is spoken after a hundred years, "Woo
the muse of the odd." . . . You may be in Hobbit
History. You may have Hobbit Hero written all over you.
You should aim to be one Hobbit they'll never forget,
like Frodo or Biblo or Hobbit_King. Don't aim to be
civilized. Don't hope that humans will keep you on as some
kind of pet. To hell with them all. You should fully
realize what society has made of you and take a terrible
revenge. Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird.
Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird, and don't do
it halfway. Put every ounce of horsepower you have
behind it. . . . Don't become a well rounded Hobbit.
Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a
thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick
in their throats like a pufferfish.<p />Moments
later I was tossed into a Khazan cell like a dwarf
tossing competition at a local tavern.

"Son,<br />Always be a good boy; don't ever play with
Orc's."<br />But I stole from an Orc in Khazan, just to watch him
cry.<br />When I hear that dinner whistle blowin' I hang my head
and cry."<p />"I bet there's rich folk eatin' in a

smokin' big cigars,<br />But I know I had it comin', I know
I can't be free,<br />But those people keep a movin'

me."<p />"Well, if they freed me from this prison,<br />I bet I'd
move on over a little farther down the line,<br />Far
from Khazan Prison, that's where I'd want to
stay,<br />Near the Blue Frog Tavern,<br />And I'd let that Dark

[[Shrsholn, you provided the punchline to the
three legged pig joke that I intended on working into
the scene, but somehow I forgot to do it.
Thanks!]]</em>
<p />[[Shrsholn and hobbit_king only THINK it's
over...]]<p />The scene: Khazan jail. The three-legged pig, with
his leg in a bandage from his fall, follows Shipy and
Shrsholn to the Khazan jail. Once Shrsholn is
incarcerated, her lawyer arrives to spring her out of
jail.<p />Unfortunately, the pig accidentally gets underfoot and the
lawyer [[who fails a L1SR vs Dex]] steps on the poor
pig. He is arrested for cruelty to animals and is
thrown into jail, too.<p />Shipy looks at Shrholn's
lawyer and laughs happily. Shrsholn's lawyer looks at
Shrsholn and laughs nervously. The pig looks at the three
of them and laughs painfully as a team of pig
conservationists tend to his latest injury. Shrsholn looks at the
camera and laughs a "why me?" laugh. She thought Shipy
was the comic relief, and here she was, a victim of a
demented narrator's mind.<p />The three cell mates
spend the night sneering at each other. When morning
breaks (ow!) the three have finally collapsed asleep in
separate corners. They are awakened with the opening of
the cell door. It's Throst. He reports that he got
quite upset after having been left out of the initial
scene, so he started a fight with the narrator and was
thrown into jail.<p />For breakfast, all 4 are served
a meager portion of bacon and sausage. A two legged
pig drags himself through the jail cell to post bail
for Throst. He says to the hobbit and his footsies
partner, "Hey, it's a rough life, sure, but the pay is
good."<p />[[But wait, the story has a happy ending. Just when all
seems lost for our main characters, the narrator
realizes he could be spending his creative energy on the
play-by-post games he's already in, so he forces a deus ex
machina on the four cell mates...]]<p />Suddenly,
without warning, and taking them completely by surprise,
a temporal vortex opens and sucks Shrsholn and
Shipy into it. For a minute, they think they've just
landed a guest spot on Sliders, until they realize that
show was cancelled a few years ago, and why would
anyone want to guest star on it anyway after they killed
off Arturo. The vortex drops them off in the middle
of the Blue Frog Tavern, where they see themselves
sitting at a table, Shipy trying to play footsies. The
pig gives his speech, and history is played out
before them. They wait a few minutes, then stroll back
to their table as if nothing ever
happened.<p />Lucky the bartender brings them their BBQ pork
sandwiches as their temporal past selves had ordered. Shipy
looks under the bun and jokes, "Where's the beef?"
Lucky says, "Sillee hobbit, this is a pork sandwich.
And," he finishes, walking off, "it's under the
pickle."<p />[fade to black, play end credits]
