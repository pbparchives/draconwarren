      This site is a not often updated page detailing the current status
      of the characters in the Tunnels and Trolls Monsters! Monsters! game
      that was run by Ken St. Andre from A.D. 1997-1998.  My brother David
      ("Jax Dracon") and I ("Taran Dracon") intend on finishing the story,
      but to do it literary justice,
      this requires more than the one paragraph ending Ken originally intended.
      <p>
      <strong>Status July 28 A.D. 2000</strong><br>
      Added a section below the current status of the characters below,
      detailing which story segments Dave and I think we need to write
      to complete the story.  Posted here for reference.

<dt><strong style="color: orange">Gristlegrim</strong> (dwarf god, NPC):
<dd>Accepts Forckum into his menagerie; admits that he might end
    up working for Lerotra'hh since things are going so bad for
    Khazan.
             
<dt><strong style="color: lightblue">Hamidullah Khairi</strong> (minotaur rogue):
<dd>Just came from a bloody battle on the southern shore of the
    dragon's mouth where Zweetz's invasion fleet had been amassing;
    now about to meet AG in AG's citadel in Khazan, after catching

<dt><strong style="color: lightblue">Jax Dracon</strong> (orc warrior):
<dd>Gristlegrim teleported him out of void in the cube, hovering
    10 miles south of Khazan, directly into AG's citadel just
    after Taran was creamed by Baruug.  Now awaits AG along with
    Hamidullah.  A giant crocodile has eaten Jax's left foot.
             
<dt><strong style="color: lightblue">Zig Niplem</strong> (gremlin rogue):
<dd>Last known location: Gristlegrim's void.  Presumably 'ported

    <td class="tnt">
    <h4 align="center">Story lines to be written, in alphabetical order
      by character</h4>
    <pre>
Arahk #10 : This is actually the finale move for Arahk that Ken never
wrote.  "Gristlegrim Revisited" (featuring those who accompany Arakh Gnakh
as he flees the scene)  Dave and I figured Arakh and Lerotrah (sp) get
Gristlegrim to take them on board his floating cube into outer space to
get reinforcements.  They ask any of the Agents who want to come with them
to join them.  I think this flight is even in Ken's Trollworld timeline on his
home page.  This might be an interesting scene if we incorporate Forckum
meeting them at the cube.  Remember Forckum is a Gristlegrim's Cube attraction
now.

Bane #14: "Sign of Hope" (Chet and Bane watch as Gristlegrim's cube arcs into
the sky into space.)

Domina #14: "?" (Tie up the Hralson thread - Recall Domina #8: "Hralson is
not what he seems...")

Jax #2: "Night Visit" (This is a gap in Jax's story line, that tells the
story of how Jax got to the Citadel and meets Blerrg.  We determined that Jax
must know Blerrg before he ends up back at the Citadel.  Anyway, Jax
goes to A.G.'s citadel at night and demands to find Taran's location from
Blerrg.  Arahk appears and scolds him, telling him to return in the morning.)
(Another thing about this is that Jax's meeting with his mother from his
first move--his mother is really Lerotrah in disguise.  Dave pitched this
idea to Ken, but Ken didn't like it.  But since Ken never finished the story,
we're gonna do it anyway, hee hee)

Jax #7: "?" (Sees Kn'agl telling him that Lerotrahh will need him in a battle
in which he will probably die.  Dave had planned a glorious demise for Jax
in space, but then we did the Goblins in the Mist game so we figured he must
survive.  :)  Anyway, Hamidullah asks Jax what the elf-woman said
and Jax realizes (L1SR on Int) that it wasn't his mother Kna'gl at the gate
from his first story segment.  In an e-mail after the game sort of died out,
Ken had communicated to me that Arahk and Lerotrah would come upon
the scene where Taran and Bleerg are squooshed by the flaming Balrog, and
say, "ah, faithful servents, even unto death."  Then Lerotrah would resurrect
Blerrg and Taran (Blerrg appears in Slabby's last entry so he must be
resurrected at some point) and ask them if they're coming with them.  Baruug is
too far messed up to be resurrected. Everyone else who ended up at the Citadel
(Zig, Jax, Domina, Gnnarggh Smith-Gnakh, Hamidullah) decides whether to flee
with them orstay to fight.

Hamidullah #5: "Vow" (Ham remembers his vow to Arakh that he'd bring back
both of his companions (Zwarthwyn and Thrudglemir) alive.  Recall that
he'd just thrown Thrudg to the ship where Zwarthwyn supposedly was, and turned
away.  New writing is that he turns back after recalling his vow, just
in time to see Thrudg die.  Saddened but fearful of what Arahk will do
to him, he uses his gate/teleport power to return to the Citadel.)

Kintrass #17: "Elven Resistence" (The first of three Kintrass moves.  He
had the most left unwritten, in our opinion.  Recall when last we saw him he
was being mistakenly attacked by some elves who were lying in wait for the
advancing lizardmen army.  Kintrass lands, elves recognize
him by his Agent's jewel, and he sees that their plan is hopeless.)

Kintrass #18: "To Bring down a Mountain" (Kintrass tries to blast the mountain
pass, to no avail, admist wizard lizard fire; Mraakkakaka (the other dragon)
shows up and they combine spells to form a reality spell that drops a mountain
onto the pass to slow the advancing lizardmen column.)

Kintrass #19: "Convalescence" (Mraakakak the dragon takes Kintrass as her
apprentice to prepare him for A.G.'s return X years later.)

Taran #27: "Axe" (Optional scene which might detail what the heck was going on
with his axe he found that had the coordinates etched into it, before
he went through the portal that led to the island.  I introduced this
plot line to make things interesting, but Ken ignored it so we therefore
have this dangling plot line)

Thrudglemir #4: "Mermen" (Thrud is killed in battle with the 3 mermen.)

Zig #7: "?" (This introduces a semi-new plot line that picks up the story
of what happened to the crown that Baruug found?  We figure that he dropped
it when he collided with the flying Zweetz ship.  Anyway... Zig is teleported
to just outside the gates of the Citadel by Gristlegrim.  He finds the
crown and gives it to Arahk.  Arahk is thrilled as he can use it to bribe/
coerce/appease Gristelgrim such that he'd take them on his cube away from
the invastion.)
